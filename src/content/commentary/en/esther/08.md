<h2>Introduction: From Tears to Royal Apparel</h2>
<p>Riches and honor were bestowed on Esther and this sinner’s wealth was laid up for Esther the queen. And Mordecai gets a promotion and a pay raise and this courageous queen’s name becomes immortal and thousands of years later she is remembered for her courageous actions. The old burlap bags are discarded and <strong>Royal Apparel</strong> is seen. It is time for a Party and you are invited to see and listen to the excitement. From tears and fears and fasting to feasting, the story unfolds like a Chinese fan.</p>

<h2>Experiencing the Great Reversal From Fasting to Feasting</h2>

<h3>Esther 8:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.</blockquote>
<p>Haman was hanged as a traitor and all his property forfeited and the king gives it to Esther the queen. Mordecai is brought before the king and introduced as the queen’s uncle. Esther needs someone to manage her estate so she makes Mordecai her steward. Take time to ponder the scriptures that are cited below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro 13:22 “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.”</p>
<p>Psa 103:6 “The LORD performs righteous deeds And judgments for all who are oppressed.”</p>
<p>Job 27:17 “He may prepare it, but the just will wear it And the innocent will divide the silver.”</p>
<p>Job 27:18 “He has built his house like the spider's web, Or as a hut which the watchman has made.” Quotes from NAS77</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Esther 8:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</blockquote>
<p>Mordecai becomes the number two man and receives the ring with the official seal of the king. <strong>God</strong> is still not mentioned but it is obvious that He is around working behind the scenes and He will continue protecting His people and bringing a savior through David’s family to the entire world.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</blockquote>
<p>Esther is still in the begging mode, she knows how to seek, ask and knock. The decree is still in effect and millions of Jews are under the interdict.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,</blockquote>
<p>From knees to please Esther now stood in the king’s presence pleading like a good lawyer the case for her people.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:5</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:</blockquote>
<p>Are you falling in love with Esther? The only persons that could plead a better case were Moses. I like the “you-and-me” part where she implores the king in theses words, “If it please the king” and “I be pleasing in his eyes”. Esther gets personal in her one-on-one entreating and her interaction with the king obtains results. It was therefore requisite in this case that, he reverses the decree written by Haman.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</blockquote>
<p>The petitioning of Esther continues for her people, she tells the king that she cannot bear it; that it will break her heart; that I shall die to see all my people massacred throughout the realm; the thought of it is shocking and shuddering; she is hoping that this intolerable act will be rescinded.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:7</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</blockquote>
<p>The king’s response to Esther was that the estate of Haman was under her control and that the arch enemy Haman had been hanged and could do no more damage to the Jews.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:8</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.</blockquote>
<p>Esther wants it all put in writing and sealed with the king’s ring so that no one can render it null and void. She wants to overturn the former decree and validate the new decree.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:9</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</blockquote>
<p>The king’s secretaries are brought in and Mordecai dictated a new decree and sent it to the satraps and governors in the entire kingdom from India to Ethiopia and sealed it with the signet ring so that it was irrevocable.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:10</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:</blockquote>
<p>It was sent out priority mail.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:11</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,</blockquote>
<p>This new edict authorized the Jews to defend themselves to the death and to kill anyone who would threaten them and to confiscate their property.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:12</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</blockquote>
<p>This was the day that had formally been fixed.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:13</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</blockquote>
<p>The Persians had a system of “pony express” and mail traveled at the fastest rate known to man in those days.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:14</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.</blockquote>
<p>This was no time to trifle when so many lives were in danger.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:15</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</blockquote>
<p>A few days ago we seen Mordecai in his mourning clothes and now he is wearing a royal robe of violet and white, a huge gold crown, and a purple cape of fine linen and the people of Shushan were exploding with joy and laughter.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:16</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.</blockquote>
<p>All over town from coffee shop to silver smiths people were talking about the news of Haman’s hanging and Mordecai’s advancement. They were walking in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<h3>Esther 8:17</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</blockquote>
<p>The mail travelled fast from hamlet to village and there was delight and pleasure and there was feasting and celebrating. And many non-Jews became Jews. Now it was dangerous not to be a Jew!</p>
