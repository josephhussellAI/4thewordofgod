<p>On the housetops and hanging over the railing to get a better view of the crises. The leaders had fled and were apprehended by the enemy and bound with chains and led off to their doom. As for the city of Jerusalem it was a day of trouble, panic and confusion&#9472;walls crashing down&#9472;the cry of death was deafening. Battering rams had broken through the walls&#9472;every attempt was being made to shore up the walls. It was too little too late. The city treasurer was preparing his sepulcher (mausoluem) but the prophet predicts that he will get bounced like a ball to a foreign nation and die in disgrace. Eliakim will be robed with his sash and empowered with civil and sacred authority. He will be like a firm peg hammered into the wall and God will hang upon him the weight of ruling the nation. Insight and inspiration awaits you in the exposition.</p>

<h2>Unveiling the Burden of the Valley of Vision</h2>

<h3>The Valley of Vision</h3>
<h3>Isaiah 22:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah foretells the invasion of Jerusalem by the Assyrians and the Babylonians. Their houses had flat roofs and was used for drying corn, hanging up linen, preparing figs and raisins. The roofs are used as places of recreation in evenings, and often sleeping places on hot nights. From the text it would indicate that the people were swarming to the housetops for a better look at the situation that was developing in the city.</p>

And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him. So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
