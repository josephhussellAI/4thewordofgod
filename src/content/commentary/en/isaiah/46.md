<p>Cyrus, who is so often marked out in the predictions of Scripture, advanced the glory of both nations to its highest pitch. Having long commanded the Median troops of Astyages, his mother’s father, and of Darius her brother and his own father-in-law, against the Chaldeans and others, he became heir to the Persian crown by his father, and to the Median by his wife, Dan. 9:1; 5:31. Under his command the Medo-Persian troops conquered the three powerful kingdoms of Lydia on the north, Babylon in the middle, and Egypt on the south; all to the westward.</p>
<p>The multitudes he slew, and the spoils he seized, were astonishing. Most of the captives who had been enslaved by the Chaldeans, he allowed to return and re-people their desolated countries. To the Jews he also restored their sacred vessels; and solemnly encouraged and kindly assisted them to rebuild their temple. He established his empire according to the most just and prudent regulations; but Cambyses, his madly cruel son and successor, almost ruined it by his expedition into Egypt and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Artaxerxes Smerdis, the magian imposter, throughout his reign did nothing more than obstruct the building of the temple. Darius Hystapes, who encouraged the building of it, and who was perhaps the Aharuerus who divorced Vashti, married Esther, advanced and pulled down Haman, and rendered Mordecai his chief minister of state, extended the empire to its utmost greatness. The conquests and government thereof reached into Iberia, Albania, Colchis, and Scythia on the north; into Lesser Asia and the Islands, Syria, and Canaan, on the west; and into Egypt, Ethiopia, part of Arabia, and India, on the south.

<h2>Discover the God Who Carries You Versus Burdensome Idols</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 46:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the weary beast.</blockquote>
<p>They broke the idols into pieces and loaded them on pack animals and on ox carts and carted them to the dump. Bel, called Belus by the Greek and Roman writers, is the same as Baal; and Nebo is interpreted by Castell and Norberg of Mercury; the two principal idols of Babylon. When that city was taken by the Persians, these images were carried in triumph.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</blockquote>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</blockquote>
<p>The pope carries an image with him on his holy parade─the crucifix─it never says anything, it never talks back, of course it never does anything either─another form of idolatry. A quick look at image worship in the Catholic church. In 726 A.D. the worship of images was forbidden by the Pope and councils. In 787 A.D. the worship of images was restored. In 820 A.D. the worship of images was forbidden. In 842 A.D. A definite and final decision for the worship of images was made.</p>

The ensign of Cyrus was a golden eagle. Under Cyrus there was one world government. He was the ruler of all nations.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 46:13</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</blockquote>
<p>When God speaks of his righteousness being near he means that Israel’s deliverance is about to happen. He is going to bring victory, not in the far off future but now. He is going to grant victory to Zion and restore Jerusalem and Israel which is his glory.</p>
