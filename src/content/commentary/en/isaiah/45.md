<p>Cyrus is selected for the execution of this important and dangerous enterprise. God says that the gates of the city will be standing open for him. His invading army consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand horse, six thousand chariots of war, and six hundred thousand infantry. God claims that he would punish Bel and bring out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. God claims that he is taking judgment on the idols of Babylon. So well was the wall and ditch destroyed that those who have made search for it have not found it.</p><blockquote>Two travelers, Buckingham and Fredrick says: &ldquo;neither the wall or the ditch has been seen the least vestige by any modern traveler. Within twenty-one miles distance along the Euphrates, and twelve miles across it in breadth, I was unable to perceive anything that could admit of any imagining, that either a wall or ditch had existed within this extensive area. The astonishment that God predicts has been completely fulfilled.&rdquo;</blockquote><h2>Unveiling the Anointed Conqueror and God's Absolute Sovereignty</h2><h3>Isaiah 45:1</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;</blockquote><p>God anointed Cyrus and took a firm grip on his hand and commissioned him to take the gird from, and loose the loins of kings. When Cyrus arrived the gates were opened for him and his army.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Isaiah 44:28:</strong> That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</li><li><strong>Isaiah 41:13:</strong> For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</li><li><strong>2 Chronicles 36:22-23:</strong> The LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia...</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:2</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:</blockquote><p>God promises to straighten out the rough and rugged ways before him.

God called Cyrus and surnamed him 150 years before he was born. The religion of Cyrus was monotheism (belief in one God).</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Job 12:18:</strong> He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</li><li><strong>See also:</strong> Exodus 19:5; Jeremiah 50:17-20</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:5</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:</blockquote><p>He wants Cyrus to know that there is no God other than him and that he was going to arm him and make him ready for war.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Isaiah 46:9:</strong> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else...</li><li><strong>Deuteronomy 4:35:</strong> Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:6</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me.

Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?</blockquote><p>Woe to you who fight against God. Why be a pot that is at odds with the potter&mdash;have you ever seen clay talk back to the potter?</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Isaiah 10:15:</strong> Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:10</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?</blockquote><p>Picture the sperm saying to the father, &ldquo;I never gave you permission to impregnate your wife,&rdquo; or the fetus saying to the mother, &ldquo;why am I cooped up like this?&rdquo;</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Deuteronomy 27:16:</strong> Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother...</li><li><strong>Malachi 1:6:</strong> A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour?</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:11</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</blockquote><p>No one tells God what he can or cannot do.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Jeremiah 33:3:</strong> Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things...</li><li><strong>Daniel 9:2-3:</strong> I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications...</li><li><strong>Ephesians 2:10:</strong> For we are his workmanship...</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:12</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.</blockquote><p>God has not only made man but he has handcrafted the heavens.

God didn&rsquo;t hire him&mdash;he told him.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Isaiah 48:14-15:</strong> I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him...</li><li><strong>Isaiah 44:28:</strong> That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd...</li><li><strong>Isaiah 52:2-3:</strong> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:14</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.</blockquote><p>They came over and volunteered their service&mdash;they believed that God was in Israel and that his God was the one and only God.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Isaiah 61:5-6:</strong> And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks...</li><li><strong>See also:</strong> Isaiah 19:24-25</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:15</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.</blockquote><p>God is a God that works behind the scenes&mdash;the entire book of Esther shows the providence of God at work in his people.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Isaiah 8:17:</strong> And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:16</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.</blockquote><p>The idol makers are ashamed, confounded, humiliated, and are now out of work and unemployed.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Isaiah 42:17:</strong> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images...</li><li><strong>Jeremiah 10:14-15:</strong> Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image...</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:17</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.</blockquote><p>Israel was promised to be saved from their captivity and they were not ashamed or disappointed in their deliverance.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Romans 11:26:</strong> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer...</li><li><strong>Joel 2:26-27:</strong> And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied... and my people shall never be ashamed.</li></ul><h3>Isaiah 45:18</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.</blockquote><p>The constant theme is a reminder of the fact that God is the source of their deliverance.
