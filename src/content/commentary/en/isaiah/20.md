<p>General Tartan, commander in chief in Syria, stormed the city of Ashdod and captured it. In the same year (712 B.C.) Isaiah was told to remove his sackcloth and shoes and to walk naked and barefoot for three years. This was a symbol that God was going to strip the clothing and shoes from the people of Egypt and Ethiopia and send them with their bare buttocks to Exile. In the meantime, Israel and the coastal people will be dismayed for their hope was in their allies Egypt. The commentary section will shed more light on the subject.</p>
