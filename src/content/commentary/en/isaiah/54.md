<p>This chapter deals with the future glory of Zion. (Future from Isaiah’s day but fulfilled when the exiles returned.) The prophet speaks of enlarging their tent and that there would be a population explosion. New towns would spring up and devastated places re-inhabited. He encourages them and tells them that they will never be ashamed. In this chapter God likens Israel to an embittered woman cast off by her husband and now recalled to the marriage bond. God tells Israel that the chance of him casting her off was as likely as day and night ceasing. Hills and mountains may disappear but his love for Israel would never cease. When they return he will have judges and shepherds who will teach their children. Righteousness will be the norm in this new society─their motto will be, “The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.” God says that her enemies will fall for her sake. No weapon turned against them shall succeed─this is God’s decree and Israel’s heritage. God’s vindication will bring Israel triumph.</p>

<h2>Unveiling the Future Glory of Zion and God’s Restored Covenant</h2>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.</blockquote>
<p>Israel would be restored both physically and spiritually. This verse is applied by Paul in Gal. 3:27 to Sarah. God wanted them to know that the children of Sarah would return and multiply and be more than the children of Hagar.</p>
