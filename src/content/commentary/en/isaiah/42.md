<p>The <strong>Messiah</strong> is coming─the spirit of the LORD is on him─he is anointed to preach good tidings, fix peoples broken hearts, release captives and open prison doors. He will not arrive with a gaudy parade or vocal demonstration. He will not turn down people who are crushed and hurting. He will restore the relationship with God by the cross. All of this is by the creator of the heavens. The one who provides all that is vital to life, God assures the Messiah that he will hold his right hand and make him a covenant to the <strong>Gentile world</strong>. He will open the eyes of the blind and the doors of the prison of unbelief.</p>
<p>This chapter sets us up for future prophesy. God claims he knows everything from the beginning to the end and when he reveals the newest prophecy all of the mountains and islands will join in praising him. First he tells us of some of the amazing things he will do in nature and tells us the end result of idols. He reveals that the exiles are to be let out of their prison houses. The main part of the prophecy is reserved for chapter 45.</p>
