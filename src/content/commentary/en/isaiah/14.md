<p>Israel will be coming home, however they must serve their 70 year sentence. The good news is that their captors will end up being their servants. They have a new song on their lips they are singing a song full of jeer and derision─a song describing the king as a tyrant filled with fury an arrogant oppressor who is hushed from his mad rage. The taunt continues with phrases about being smote, trampled and never ending blows─a ruler who angrily gave the people a good thrashing and in his rage furiously tyrannized them unceasingly with no one stepping in to help. The song names him as Lucifer and then sings about his death and burial without a state funeral. The song tells us that Lucifer is none other than the king of Babylon. The song continues with the King of Babylon arriving in hell with a reception from others just like him. The commentary section will supply all the details.</p>
