<p>This bunch of misguided God dropouts has walked out on God. We wonder why bother even trying to get this bunch of featherbrained misfits back into the fold. They were bad from the top of their head to the bottom of their feet. They lived like they had been in a Sodom and Gomorrah training camp. However, they still sacrificed but it was all a sham. God wanted them to straighten up and do what’s right and he promises to wipe the slate clean. The leaders are dishonest cronies who love idols but its curtains for these God-traitors if they continue fooling around in the goddess gardens. My commentary will give you more insight into the book.</p>

<h2>Unveiling the Great Arraignment and the Divine Call to Reason</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 1:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah was divinely granted a sight into the future while in a state of ecstasy. In these visions God showed him what would happen in future times. The vision occurred during the following four administrations: Uzziah (783-742), Jotham (742-735), Ahaz (735-715), and Hezekiah (715-686). Dates from Holman Bible Atlas p. 181.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Num 12:6:</strong> And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, <em>I</em> the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, <em>and</em> will speak unto him in a dream.</li>
<li><strong>Num 24:4:</strong> He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling <em>into a trance,</em> but having his eyes open:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</blockquote>
<p>They are admonished to listen as God makes his case against them. God had taken care of them like a parent takes care of their children but Israel had rebelled against him.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deu 30:19:</strong> I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, <em>that</em> I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</blockquote>
<p>Even animals know whose boss and where the feed comes from. God says his people have no discernment they acted like a bunch of guilt ridden God-dropouts.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 1:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah describes them as a bunch of vandals rotten to the core staggering beneath a heavy load of guilt. The prophet paints a picture of them as bad to the bone, degenerate, perverted, wrongdoers. They had walked out on God, gave him the cold shoulder, never looked back and broke the contract with God and he is going to kick them out.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jer 16:12:</strong> And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:5</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</blockquote>
<p>You keep betraying God so why should he send corrective measures? You will revolt more and more. From head to heart you are diseased. The gears inside their head are not meshing and their heart has a large clot.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jer 2:30:</strong> In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</blockquote>
<p>Your country has been devastated by foreigners, plunder and devastation is everywhere. You stand by and watch helplessly as they devour your crops.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psa 77:2:</strong> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</li>
<li><strong>READ:</strong> Jer 6:14, Jer 30:12, Nah 3:19.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:7</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</blockquote>
<p>The prophet pictures the cities devastated and lying in ashes; their farms plundered; barns burned down, fences wrecked, everything turned upside down and ransacked.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 6:11:</strong> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:8</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah paints three graphic pictures of Zion: She looks like a shanty in a cucumber patch after harvest time; or a city blockaded so no supplies can enter, or a guard shack in a vineyard after the grapes have been gathered.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lam 2:1:</strong> How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <em>and</em> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:9</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</blockquote>
<p>If you could travel back in time and take a look at Sodom and Gomorrah. If God had not intervened they would have been wiped out like Sodom and Gomorrah. With this comparison Isaiah won’t win the “person of the year” award at the next city banquet.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rom 9:29:</strong> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:10</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</blockquote>
<p>God had his fill of their grain-fed fatted calves what he wants them to do is wash of the grime of their schemes and crimes he wants them to block oppression and defend the vulnerable.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mic 3:10-11:</strong> They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, <em>Is</em> not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:11</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</blockquote>
<p>God says that when they came into his court of worship who gave them the idea of acting like this.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>1Sa 15:22:</strong> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD <em>as great</em> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey <em>is</em> better than sacrifice, <em>and</em> to hearken than the fat of rams.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:12</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</blockquote>
<p>All of this was meaningless and worthless without true justice. Isaiah describes them as a bunch of pious frauds holding solemn meetings, festivals and convocations; it was all talk and no walk.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mic 6:8:</strong> He hath shewed thee, O man, what <em>is</em> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:13</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</blockquote>
<p>God says he can’t tolerate any more of their new moons and appointed feasts. It was no more than ritual and charade. God was weary with their trivial religious gatherings.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mal 1:10:</strong> Who <em>is there</em> even among you that would shut the doors <em>for nought?</em> neither do ye kindle <em>fire</em> on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:14</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</blockquote>
<p>Meetings, meetings, meetings, monthly, weekly, daily-meetings for this, meetings for that; God says he hated them. When they did their prayer performance God was looking the other way.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amo 5:21:</strong> I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:15</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</blockquote>
<p>With blood on their hands it was drowning out their prayers. God says to take a spiritual shower and wash up─take a long shower and wash off the grime and grit of evil and help the down-and-out.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 59:2:</strong> But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid <em>his</em> face from you, that he will not hear.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</blockquote>
<p>God wants them to sit down and settle the dispute between them and then he will wash them white as snow. God gives them the options and they are making the call.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psa 82:3-4:</strong> Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid <em>them</em> out of the hand of the wicked.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:18</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</blockquote>
<p>They can dig in and resist God or they can have an attitude adjustment and eat the best of their land.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 1:20</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</blockquote>

<h3>Isaiah 1:21</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</blockquote>
<p>Whoredom had become a way of life for them. They had frequented the “sex-and-religion-shrines.” The chaste city had become unchaste─she was a slut and Isaiah had likened her to Sodom and Gomorrah. In olden days she was a city that was known for justice and righteousness but now murder was on the headlines of the daily paper.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jer 2:20-21:</strong> For of old time I have broken thy yoke, <em>and</em> burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:23</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</blockquote>
<p>Your politicians are in cahoots with the mob, you are hand in glove with crooks─bribery, greed and corruption are the norm. Your judges itch for a gift, justice is denied the poor and money buys justice. These corrupt officials never stand-up or stick-up for the homeless or defenseless.</p>

<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eze 20:38:</strong> And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I <em>am</em> the LORD.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 1:26</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</blockquote>
