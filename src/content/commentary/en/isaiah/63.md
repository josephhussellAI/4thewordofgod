<p>Edom was the brother of Israel through Esau. The “land of Edom” (Gen. 36:16) was mountainous and called “the mountain of Seir.” It is a wild and rugged region, and its old capital was Bozrah (Isa 63:1). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites, who were destroyed by the Edomites (Deut. 2:12). At the time of the Exodus, they refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land (Num. 20:14-21) and always maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David (2 Sam 8:14) and afterwards by Amaziah (2 Ch. 25:11). But they regained their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom (2 Ki. 16:6), made war against Israel.</p>

<p>They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards, they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Babylonian power (Jer. 27:3-6). The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten forever. In Petra, “where kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles.” God has deeded all the land of Edom to be a wildlife refuge forever.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Jer 27:3-6</strong> And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; I have made the earth, the man and the beast that <em>are</em> upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me. And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</blockquote>

<p>No student of prophecy will be satisfied till he learns the full story of Edom. Genesis 25 records the birth of Esau (Edom). Rebecca had two nations in her womb, then Jacob bought Esau's birthright—Esau’s land inheritance resulted in Esau becoming so embittered that he decided to kill Jacob. First, we see Esau in Sacred History. Then we trace his lineage to Mt. Seir, and his nation was known as Edom. A full list of the dukes and kings is recorded in Genesis. This nation always gave Israel trouble (2 Sam 8:14). After 7 centuries these nations existed side by side, the older made servant to the younger by David. The rivalry and cruelty of Edom were not able to keep his stubborn neck from the yoke. In the days of Jehoram, king of Judah, they revolted (2 Kings 8:2). Later Amaziah was back at war with Edom (2 Kings 14:7, 2 Ch. 25:12).</p>

<p>The Edomites were often subject to the Jews, and the Jews were never the servants of the Edomites. Thus the prophecy was fulfilled for 13 centuries. Take a trip up Mount Seir and you will see the ruins of thirty cities utterly laid waste and desolate all of these ruins lay within 3 days journey of the Red Sea. These cities and their ruins can be viewed on the internet. The Edomites have disappeared from the earth. They have not been heard from since the second century.</p>

<p>The land that they inhabited is a God-forsaken land that is occupied by animals. God gave this territory to the animals and tells us that their deed is perpetual. This territory is guarded by Arabs with a degree of hostility scarcely paralleled. They do not live there and allow no one else to. Archeologists write about the numerous tombs, ancient sepulchers, mausoleums, fragments of columns, and ruins of palaces. Edom is nothing more than a graveyard inhabited by snakes, scorpions, and lions.</p>

<p>Esau had married two heathen wives and a daughter of Ishmael. He hated God and the Jewish religion. He sold his birthright and was a profane man. He went down the path of superstition and wickedness. They lived by kidnapping and plunder. Their territory was called the border of wickedness.</p>

<p>“From this remote past the prophecy hung over him. And now his capital city rises up to testify to the truth of heaven. A city of rock, its temples, theaters, palaces, triumphal arches, dwelling houses, aqueducts, all hewn out of solid rock, presenting one of the greatest lessons in the whole world. A vast amphitheater surrounded by mountains on all sides, in their native grandeur, lifting their summits five or six hundred feet high, the city of rock, the capital of Edom, (Petra) lies in desolation. The tombs and mausoleums in number and greatness testify to the fact that long ago kings ruled in that land. Where are they now? Shall we believe Moses and the prophets, when we see a city as imperishable as the rock-ribbed hills, her monuments of greatness forsaken, not a foot of man to tread her streets, worship in her temples, visit her theaters or live in her palaces? This city so singular, so remote in origin, so rich in historical associations, as beautiful in desolation, stands forth as a colossal monument to the veracity of the prophets of God.” (<em>The Prophecies Unveiled</em> by A.M. Morris P.26, 27. 1914)</p>

<h3>Testimony of Scriptures</h3>
<p><strong>Gen 25:19-33</strong> outlines the birth of Esau and Jacob, the struggle within Rebekah's womb, and the selling of the birthright. Read also: <strong>Heb 12:14-17; Mal 1:2-5; Oba 1:1-17; Eze 35:1-15; Jer 49:14-21; Isa 34:10-17; Psa 83:1-8</strong></p>

<h2>Unveiling the Messiah's Vengeance and Israel's Prayer for Mercy</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 63:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> See my commentary on Amos 1:11 for a description of Edom. Edom was Esau, who was a brother of Jacob, who was Israel (Predicted in Gen. 27:40). God will not tolerate any improper motive against his people. This one who comes from Edom is our <strong>Messiah</strong>—his garments are dyed red with blood. He is announcing vindication for he marched in the fullness of his strength. Bozrah was the chief town of Edom.</p>

<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Jesus says that he had to tread the winepress alone for no man helped him. No nation had made war with Edom for its wrong doing. The Messiah says he will tread them in his fury and they will be trod down in his rage. His garment was stained with Edom’s blood.</p>
