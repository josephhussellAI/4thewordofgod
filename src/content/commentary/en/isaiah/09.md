<p>Zebulun and Naphtali was a land that death overshadowed and Isaiah prophecies that it will be a place where light will spring up─a son will be born and given the throne of David and his kingdom was to be henceforth forever. This was going to happen and did happen when Christ came and lived in Galilee of the Gentiles. More prophecies regarding the invasion of Israel by the Syrians and Philistines and the cutting off of the head and tail of Israel, then he denounces their leaders for destroying the nation and bringing on a crises─their wickedness is likened to a raging forest fire that destroys everything before it. Finally the land is darkened and this overshadowed death hole results in their eating their own flesh. Read the exposition for more fine points.</p>

<h2>Unveiling the Great Light and Prince of Peace</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 9:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.</blockquote>
<p>In former times the land of Zebulun and Naphtali had been afflicted but in the future these very lands would be filled with glory. These people had felt the first brunt of the invasion of Assyria. She is called <strong>Galilee of the nations</strong> because Assyria had taken the Jews into captivity and repopulated the country with other nationalities.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 9:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.</blockquote>
<p>These people had walked in a death shadowed land for generations and now there is a ray of hope, the <strong>son of righteousness</strong> is going to shine on them. Jesus the light of the world will live in this dark region.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 9:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</blockquote>
<p>The nation had increased with migrants and still walked in darkness till the “Son of Righteousness” appeared with healing in his wings. There was abundant joy and exuberating when Christ came. It is compared to the joy of an abundant harvest or booty taken in war. It was a festival of joy and great celebration.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.</blockquote>
<p>God had removed the cross bar from their shoulder and taken the goad or whip from the driver and freed them from their captivity like what had happened in the days of Gideon.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 9:5</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.</blockquote>
<p>All the clothing of these invading solders will be soaked in blood and burned in a large fire.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 9:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</blockquote>
<p>This verse predicts the coming of Jesus. He is not only a child but he is a son and his name shall be called wonderful. He is our:</p>

<h3>Isaiah 9:7</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.</blockquote>
<p>The government of this ruler was to be a government of peace that would have no end and he was to sit upon the throne of David and rule henceforth forever. Jesus is declared to be the son of David and the scriptures proclaim that he was to sit upon David’s throne. On the day of Pentecost Peter preached that Jesus was resurrected and was seated on <strong>David’s throne</strong>. I have quoted the scriptures─you decide!</p>

<h3>Isaiah 9:8</h3>

<p>This group of people was rebellious and lacked a proper respect for God and was filled with pride and arrogance. They were so haughty that they were saying if disaster comes we will rebuild better than before and if the army cuts down our sycamores then we will replant them with cedar trees.</p>

For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</blockquote>
<p>God is going to stir up the Assyrians and cause Israel’s enemies to join with Rezin. Syria from the East and the Philistines from the West are going to take on Israel with open mouth and gulp them down but God is still angry and his hand is ready to strike.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.</blockquote>

For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</blockquote>
<p>The nation as a whole had become very corrupt both young and old. It was therefore appropriate that God would have no joy in them. They were hypocritical and dirty mouthed.</p>

And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</blockquote>
<p>Through the vengeance of the Lord the country was ravaged, burned black and scorched by his fury. In this time of war each was fighting to steal the others food. They were fighting over the food allotment─no one had enough and conditions worsen and finally they eat their own children.</p>
