<p>In this chapter you will see the redeemed saints singing and chanting a hymn of praise. They are referred to as a righteous nation indwelt by the spirit of God. They are a testimony of the righteousness of their God. Their song is about a despised, persecuted people who suffered hardships and discrimination at the hand of tyrants and will see them crushed to the ground. The song further reveals that the wicked reprobates who deny God will be crushed. The hymn continues with the promise of and abundant increase in the population of the righteous and a promise of the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 26:20</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</blockquote>
