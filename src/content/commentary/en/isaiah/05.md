<p>Isaiah is singing a song about a vineyard that had been well cared for—it had been grubbed, briers cut and burned, cultivated and a good selection of vine stock planted. The owner had built a fence around it and built a guard tower in the center of it and a wine vat to squeeze the grapes in. However, at harvest time it yielded nothing more than a few sour grapes. As the song continues we are informed that the vines are the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem and that the owner is going to cut down the vineyard and turn the field into a pasture for sheep and goats. The owner was looking for a crop of justice but all he got was a crop of victims. The song is about these high-rollers, rising before breakfast and boozing it up and then spending the day evicting land owners so they could acquire their land. They were using lies to sell evil so they could line their pockets but the land owner is going to “hiss” a nation from the north and they are going to come with a vast army and carry these people into exile. The entire song is waiting for you in the exposition.</p>

<p>He built a fence around it and cleared it of all the stones and prepared the soil for planting, next he picked the very best grape vines and planted them. While they are growing he builds a lookout tower in the center in order to keep the animals and thieves out then he builds a winepress in the center of vineyard expecting a grape harvest. But the unexpected happened at harvest time the grapes were wild grapes, not many on the cluster and they were small and sour.</p>
