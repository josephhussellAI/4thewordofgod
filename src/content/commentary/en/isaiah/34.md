<p>The land of Edom (Gen. 36:16) was mountainous and was called "the mountain of Seir." It is a wild and rugged region, and its old capitol was Bozrah (Isa 63:1). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites (Deut. 2:12). At the time of the Exodus, they refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land (Num. 20:14-21) and always maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David (2 Sam 8:14) and afterwards by Amaziah (2 Ch. 25:11). But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom (2 Ki. 16:6), made war against Israel. They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards, they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Babylonian power (Jer. 27:3-6).</p>
<p>The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten forever. In Petra, "where kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles." God has deeded all the land of Edom to be a wildlife refuge forever.</p>

<h2>Unveiling the Sword of the Lord and Idumea's Desolation</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 34:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.</blockquote>
<p>The news for all mankind is about to be published—this was not local news but worldwide.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psa 49:1:</strong> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 34:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.</blockquote>
<p>God is going to turn the world upside down. The land will be emptied when God pours out his fury.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jer 25:15-17:</strong> For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. Then took I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me.</li>
<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 24:1-3</li>

<h3>Isaiah 34:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</blockquote>

<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 14:19:</strong> But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.</li>
<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 14:20; 2Ki 9:35; Eze 32:5-6</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 34:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.</blockquote>
<p>Stars falling—sun darkened—heavens rolled together, is symbolic of the collapse of world governments. Every time a nation fell the prophets likened it to the fall of a mountain (kingdom.)</p>

<h3>Isaiah 34:5</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.</blockquote>
<p>When God gets finished, Idumaea (Edom) will fall under the terrible judgment of God. The following is a quote from my commentary on Amos regarding Edom. Take a trip up Mount Seir and you will see the ruins of thirty cities utterly laid waste and desolate all of these ruins lay within 3 days journey of the Red Sea. These cities and their ruins can be viewed on the internet. The Edomites have disappeared from the earth. They have not been heard from since the second century. The land that they inhabited is a God forsaken land that is occupied by animals. God gave this territory to the animals and tells us that their deed is perpetual.</p>

<p>The sword was covered with blood from the slaying of lambs and goats—these animals became a feast for the army of the Chaldeans.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
