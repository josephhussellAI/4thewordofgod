<p>From the stump of Jesse a root will produce a branch and God will give him extraordinary powers and he will be clothed in fairness and usher in a time of peace for he is the prince of peace. The prophet paints a picture of wild animals lying down with tame animals to depict the peacefulness of the messiah. He further sees the Messiah reaching out to the four corners of the earth and bringing back the remaining exiles. Isaiah paints a picture for us of the drying up of rivers and building roads so that the exiles can return. You are invited to explore the exposition and scripture references.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 11:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.</blockquote>
<p>Wolves will live with the lambs; leopards will share his bed with the kid goats, calves and lions eating from the same trough, beef cattle and lions laying down in mid-day together and a little child leading them with a lead rope. In those days wolf and lamb, lion and bullock, will dwell together.</p>
<p>Daniel has a lion with eagle’s wings and a leopard with a fowl’s wings and four heads in Dan. 7, which represented the kingdom of Persia and Greece. When kingdoms stopped acting like animals and laid down their arms and become peaceful with their neighbors it could be said that the wolf was laying down with the lamb. When Israel returned from captivity wolf and lamb, lion and bullock are dwelling together.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it was no strange thing that wolves and lambs were eating together (a peace pact was made between nations), lions were eating with oxen. Snakes were eating dust and not biting their children. After careful examination of the scriptures, you will arrive at this conclusion: Israel has returned from captivity and Persia rules the world and all the nations were under this one world government and so the wolf was dwelling with the lamb.</p>
