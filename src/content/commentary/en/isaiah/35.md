<p>God is bringing the exiles home. Valleys, hills, mountains, trees and grass are rejoicing for their return. Weak hands and feeble knees gained new energy─God is redressing their grievances─He is taking vengeance on their enemies. Aforetime Israel was blind, deaf and hardhearted─but now they possess eyes of understanding and hearts of praise. God has a highway of holiness for the redeemed to walk on. Lame are jumping for joy and people are singing for the first time─its joy, joy, joy. God blessed their forests, pasture land and wasteland─God has made the lion lay down with the lamb. The commentary section is waiting for you to read.</p>
