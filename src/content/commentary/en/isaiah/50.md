<p>God had not divorced Israel, she had left God by her misconduct. God had not sold Israel, she sold herself to sin. God had called but there was no answer—God lets them know that his hand was not too short to reach down and release them—He tells them that he is able to turn out the lights and pull a dark drape over the skies. God’s servant never flinched at the whipping post—they yanked out his heart and spit in his face, he was untouched by their insults because God was with him. He set his face like a flint and confronted his enemies. All of Gods enemies will be like moth eaten garments.</p>

<h2>Witnessing the Determined Obedience of the Suffering Servant</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 50:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</blockquote>
<p>Is your mother gone because I divorced her? Have you seen a copy of the divorce papers? It was your mother’s misconduct that put her away. When did I sell you to some creditor? Have you seen the bill of sale? No, you sold yourself by your wrong doing. Husbands often sent bills of divorcement to their wives on slight occasions; and fathers, oppressed with debt, sold their children till the year of release. But this, saith God, cannot be my case: I am not governed by any such motives, nor am I urged by any such necessity. Your captivity and afflictions are the fruits of your own folly and wickedness.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 50:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.</blockquote>
<p>When I called no answer came—Do you think my hand is too weak to redeem you from captivity? Think again, I can dry up the sea and make rivers dry beds.</p>

<p>No, I am as powerful as ever. I can turn the lights out in the heavens and close the drapes.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 50:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.</blockquote>
<p>A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a silver basket. God had endowed the prophet with timely words to encourage tired people—he wakes up early in the morning alert and responsive to the will of God.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 50:5</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 50:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</blockquote>
<p>He followed orders and removed his shirt and bent down to the whipping post—they pulled out my beard by the roots and spit in my face. The eastern people always held the beard in great veneration; and to pluck a man's beard is one of the grossest indignities that can be offered.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 50:7</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</blockquote>
<p>Because God stood by him he was not confounded—he was untouched by their insults—sticks and stones may break his bones but words will never hurt him—he was not dismayed or ashamed—he set his face like flint and never once weakened from his determination.</p>

<p>If a person fears the LORD and obeys the word of his servant even though he has no light to walk in let him trust God and lean upon him.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.</blockquote>
<p>Many are walking in the light of their own fire and warm themselves from its flames—these people never rely upon the hand of God and so they live among sorrows.</p>
