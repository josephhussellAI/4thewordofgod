<p>Righteous men are perishing and nobody seems to care&#9472;they find rest and escape the calamity to come. An evil brood had been spawned&#9472;born of sluts, witches, sorceresses and adulterers&#9472;this worthless race&#9472;this brood of rebels&#9472;this bunch of God-haters were senseless, heartless and ruthless. They sought to satisfy their lusts in any shaded area&#9472;fornicating at a whim&#9472;having children out of wedlock and slaying them under rock cliffs, all in the name of Molech, their heathen god. They sought to appease their no-god with drink offerings, prayers and child sacrifice. They had made their own bed! They bargained and embraced and enlarged their whoredom. They slept with anyone in a one-night stand. This whorish religion and sex shrines lured young men into the sex crime&#9472;all the while they were living it up. They went to hell and back to satisfy their lust. They felt no sense of guilt over their acts of perversion. They didn&#8217;t want God and so they lived with their depraved mind. When God chastened them they went right on doing their heart content. They paraded their Sodom like ways and were proud of it. God says he will heal, and restore this hell bent bunch however; it will take a 70 year prison term to break them of their idolatry. Some were incorrigible and never changed; he compares them to ocean waves churning up mire and scum. There is no peace says my God for them.</p>
