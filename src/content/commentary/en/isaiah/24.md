<p>Jerusalem is fallen and Judea is ruined. God has overthrown the entire country; God has cut off head and tail. The leaders had lead them to ruin. They had transgressed the law, followed the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the Lord. They mocked and despised the prophets and went so far away that there was no remedy.</p>
<p>The land was mourning and the forest was ashamed. They had changed the ordinances and broken the everlasting covenant they had defiled themselves with the nations that God had spued out. They sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils—the land was polluted with blood—this people would not walk in God’s ways—they were cursed in the city and on their farms—cursed when they came in and cursed when they went out—therefore, they shall surely perish from the land. The comments in this chapter will provide more insight to this catastrophe.</p>

For the leaders of this people cause <em>them</em> to err; and <em>they that are</em> led of them <em>are</em> destroyed. Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one <em>is</em> an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <em>is</em> stretched out still.</li>

And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye <em>be</em> in your enemies' land; <em>even</em> then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</li>

  <li><strong>Eze 32:7-8</strong> And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.</li>
