<p>The Moabites were a product of Lot’s incest with his daughters. They dwelt eastward along the banks of the river Arnon, which runs westward into the Dead Sea. Their principal cities were Ar, Kir, Bozrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, &amp;c. When the Israelites on their way to Canaan, camped on their border they along with the Ammonites had a scheme to hire Balaam to curse that people. The scheme back-fired and both were excluded from the congregation of Israel for all generations.</p>
<p>During the Judges the Moabites grievously oppressed the Israelites, but were driven out of Canaan by Ehud, and Eglon their king was slain. Both Saul and David warred with the Moabites. David conquered the Ammonites and Moabites and put them in subjection. This lasted for about 150 years until Ahab died and they rebelled and regained their liberty. When the Syrians and the Assyrians conquered the ten tribes of Israel the Moabites seized several cities which lay next to them and ravaged them in a most inhuman way and murdered its inhabitants. They assisted the Chaldeans in ravaging the kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>Not long after the fall of Jerusalem the Moabites along with the Ammonites assisted in the murder of Gedaliah and provoking Nebuchadnezzar who invaded their country and carried off their wealth, burning their cities, and murdering the inhabitants, leaving their land an absolute desert. In the next chapter we will learn more about the small remnant that remains and how during the Maccabean era that Janneus, the grand nephew of Judas Maccabeus reduced the Moabites into a state of slavery to the Jewish nation. Fifty of their cities lay in ruins and no one dwells there unto this day. For more information on the Moabites see my article in the book of Amos chapter two.</p>

The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 15:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.</blockquote>
<p>The streets of their towns were filled with people wearing burlap clothing and on the patios of their roof tops they were burdened with lamenting and soaked with tears.</p>

<li><strong>Isa 16:8-9</strong> For the fields of Heshbon languish, <em>and</em> the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come <em>even</em> unto Jazer, they wandered <em>through</em> the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.

<li><strong>Jer 48:34</strong> From the cry of Heshbon <em>even</em> unto Elealeh, <em>and even</em> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <em>even</em> unto Horonaim, <em>as</em> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</li>

<p>Even the prophet is grieveing for Moab. As they wind their way up the slope of the mountain trail every step was marked with tears─they were wailing─we are ruined─the cries of disaster could be heard all the way to Horonaim. They are all heading to their chapel in the hills to implore their god for help. There is sobs, shaking, and grief as Moab trembles in despair.</p>

And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; <em>their</em> shouting <em>shall be</em> no shouting. From the cry of Heshbon <em>even</em> unto Elealeh, <em>and even</em> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <em>even</em> unto Horonaim, <em>as</em> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches <em>that</em> he hath gotten are perished.</li>

<h3>Isaiah 15:9</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.</blockquote>
<p>It was a slaughter at the border crossing and the stream of Dimon was running with blood from the slain. The people of Moab that escape will be finished off with the lions as they head to the mountains for refuge. God was not finished yet with Moab for her remnant would be hunted down by the lions.</p>
