<p>Refugees are seen at the border crossing of willow creek seeking counsel—trying to stay hid from their enemies—begging other nations to allow them sanctuary among them—the pride of Moab is brought down as she begs for help. The destruction of her cities and farms caused the hearts strings of the prophet to reverberate with sorrow upon sorrow. Her wines that she exported have ceased—all her vineyards have been destroyed and her homes burned. She goes up to her house of worship and seeks help from Moloch her idol god but nothing happens except disaster upon disaster.</p>
