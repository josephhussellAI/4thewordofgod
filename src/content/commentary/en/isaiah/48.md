<p>Jacob who was surnamed Israel was boasting and proud that they lived in the Holy city and pretended that they were living by the commandments of God all the while it was nothing but a sham. God had declared things in advance but they were too thick-headed to understand. The fact that revelation of things to come was so well established that no one could claim that it was the result of an idol. God promises to do a new thing, something that had never before happened─he will call a heathen king to release the captives and rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. God reminds this bunch of idol addicts that they had been tried in the furnace of affliction─that they were the real cause of God’s name being blasphemed every day. Again he reminds them that he is sending his battle axe (Cyrus) to destroy the Chaldeans. God wants them to know who was “running the show”─the one and only God who made earth and sky. If their parents had obeyed they would have been as numerous as the sands of the seashore. Finally he urges them to flee Babylon with singing and shouting.</p>

<h2>Unveiling God's Purpose in the Furnace of Affliction</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 48:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.</blockquote>
<p>Jacobs name was changed to Israel and his roots came from Judah (out of the waters of Judah). These people did not fear God and did not walk after his commands or statutes. They swore by the name God but not in good faith─not in honesty or sincerity─they didn’t mean a word of it.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gen 32:28:</strong> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</li>
<li><strong>2Ki 17:34:</strong> Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</li>
<li><strong>Deu 6:13:</strong> Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 48:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.</blockquote>
<p>They boasted of living in the Holy city and pretended to live by the laws of that God.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 48:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.</blockquote>
<p>God had declared things to happen in advance─sometimes things happened as soon as it was spoken. God has short term prophecies and long term prophecies.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 41:22:</strong> Let them bring <em>them</em> forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they <em>be,</em> that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 48:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</blockquote>
<p>Gods people of that generation had a face as hard as stone─stiff-necked (couldn’t turn and go the right way)─obstinate with a thick head (bird brained) hard heads and flint-faced.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jer 5:3:</strong> O LORD, <em>are</em> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, <em>but</em> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</li>
<li><strong>Eze 3:7:</strong> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel <em>are</em> impudent and hardhearted.</li>
<li><strong>Exo 32:9:</strong> And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <em>is</em> a stiffnecked people:</li>
<li><strong>2Ki 17:14:</strong> Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 48:5</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.</blockquote>
<p>God revealed things before hand and they were witnesses of it so that these bird brained folks couldn’t go around saying that this was a result of their devotion to some dumb idol.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>

<p>He showed them─fulfilled before their very eyes─and they still didn’t get it.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 43:8-10:</strong> Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, <em>It is</em> truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 48:7</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</blockquote>
<p>God says that he is going to do a new thing─not the same old thing or a variation of the same old thing. He wanted to make sure that they couldn’t say “I know all this.”</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 6:9-10:</strong> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 48:8</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</blockquote>
<p>They never heard (their ears were closed)─you never knew (closed mind)─God knew the kind of people that he was dealing with. He knew they were transgressors from the womb. These people were not good listeners─they had a history of ignoring God. Their tract record proved them to be transgressors.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exo 32:7-10:</strong> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted <em>themselves:</em> They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These <em>be</em> thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <em>is</em> a stiffnecked people: Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.</li>
<li><strong>Isa 29:10-11; Hos 1:9:</strong> (Read Passages)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of God’s name and his honor he held his anger and didn’t wash his hands of them or wipe them out.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</blockquote>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 48:11</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.</blockquote>
<p>If God permitted the heathen to destroy Jacob then his name would be forever blasphemed but God was not about to give his glory to the idol worshipers.</p>

<p>The books of the law were replete with scriptures that foretold what would take place if Israel turned from the LORD to idols─this had not been kept secret but was on the lips of the prophets─so the decision to take down Babylon, free the exiles, rebuild Jerusalem and the temple was not a spur of the moment decision.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
