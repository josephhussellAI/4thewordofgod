<p>Hezekiah entertains an envoy from Babylon—he is so delighted with the letter and gifts that he opens all the vaults and jewelry boxes for them to see the world’s greatest collection of valuables that he and his ancestors had amassed over centuries. He showed them the farms and stables, herds of cattle, horses and sheep—opened the kitchen cabinets and showed them the spices—this proud king bragged every step of the tour. When the envoys leave Isaiah will pay the king a visit and spell out on no uncertain terms what God will do for this foolish act.</p>

<h2>Uncovering the Dangers of Hezekiah's Prideful Tour</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 39:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.</blockquote>
<p>Upon the news that Hezekiah had recovered from his fatal disease the king of Babylon sent envoys with a letter and a present to Hezekiah.</p>

<li><strong>2Ch 32:23-33</strong> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</li>

<h3>Isaiah 39:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</blockquote>
<p>Hezekiah was delighted that the king of Babylon would send a letter and gifts—so he takes the ambassadors on a personal tour of the palace. Hezekiah had constructed vaults to hold all of his silver and gold and precious stones—display cases for the spices and trophy cases for shields and boxes for jewelry—then he gives them a tour of the place where he had built storage for the grain and the wine cellars and a place to store the olive oil—he gave them a tour of the horse barns and sheep barns and then gave them a tour of the armory.</p>
