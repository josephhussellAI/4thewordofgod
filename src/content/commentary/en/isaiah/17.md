<p>Syria was sometimes called Aram. Their country lay on the north-east of Canaan and Mount Lebanon. They were conquered by David about 2964 B.C. but about 60 years later under the leadership of Rezon who formed a kingdom for himself at Damascus, which extended itself over all Syria and proved itself to be a scourge in the side of Israel, particularly in the days of Baasha, Ahab, etc. God did not suffer the injuries which they did to his people to pass unpunished.</p>
<p>Twice, with a handful of men, Ahab routed their huge armies, and brought them to the brink of ruin (I Kings 20). A noise in the trees terrified them from their cruel siege of Samaria (2 Kings 7) and Joash and Jeroboam, reduced them to the very brink of despair. But more terrible judgments overtook them. Hired by Ahaz, the Assyrians burned their cities, murdered the inhabitants, and took survivors to the slave world. During the decline of Assyria the Syrians returned and repeopled their country. But not long after Nebuchadnezzar marched his troops into Syria and burned Damascus and murdered the inhabitants or reduced them to slavery. Century after century they have been at war from Alexander to the Romans, Eqyptians, Parthians, Persians, Saracens, the crusaders and the Druses, it has been one scene after another of plundering Arabs murdering it inhabitants.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Burden of Damascus and Coming Harvest of Sorrow</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 17:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.</blockquote>
<p>This inspired prediction regarding the demise of Damascus as a city was fulfilled when it was invaded by the Tiglathpileser king of Assyria. He captured the capital city of Syria and slew Rezin their king.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>2Ki 16:9</strong> And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried <em>the people of</em> it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</li>
<li>Read: <strong>Jer 49:23-27; Amo 1:3-5</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 17:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</blockquote>
<p>The surrounding cities and townships were deserted and turned into a sheep run where the animals roamed undisturbed by people.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>2Ki 15:29</strong> In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 17:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.</blockquote>
<p>Ephraim will lose its defenses─Damascus will lose its sovereignty─their fate is one. The prophet predicts that both will look like Israel when she lost her glory.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 7:8</strong> For the head of Syria <em>is</em> Damascus, and the head of Damascus <em>is</em> Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</li>
<li><strong>Isa 7:16</strong> For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</li>
<li><strong>2Ki 17:6</strong> In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor <em>by</em> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</li>
<li><strong>Hos 13:16</strong> Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</li>
<li><strong>Amo 3:14-15</strong> That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground. And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 17:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.</blockquote>
<p>Jacob was the founder of Israel. This verse likens them to a person who had gained weight and now lost weight and looked like a rack-of-bones. The prophet predicts that they will look like walking death.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 10:16</strong> Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</li>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.</blockquote>
<p>I helped my father gather the corn in my arms and put it in the shock, so the prophet likens Israel and Syria being gathered by the Assyrians and carried away into captivity. He likens it to gathering corn in the rich fertile land of the valley or Rephaim.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 17:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God of Israel.</blockquote>
<p>When the crops are gathered in there is a small amount left that is called gleanings which were left for the poor and homeless to pick. The prophet likens the few poor stragglers left behind to the “two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough.” That is how it would be when Damascus and Israel were stripped bare of its people leaving only a few behind.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.</blockquote>
