<p>God wants them to know who formed them and tells them that he will bear them. Carry them and deliver them because he had chosen them. He is going to pour out his spirit on them and their offspring. They will spring forth like a garden with a sprinkler system. Israel will once again proudly wear the LORD’s name. God claims that there is no other god and that he is the creator.</p>
<p>The prophet launches into a long satire on the folly of idolatry. The idol maker’s labor long hours with axe, hammer, tongs and compass to shape an idol. We were made in the image of God and idols were made in the image of man or beast. Idol worshippers lack understanding—they just can’t bring themselves to see that their fake god is nothing but a block of wood. Finally the prophet pictures heaven and earth and all creation singing because God had taken up the cause of Israel and no idol had lifted a hand to deliver them. God says that he frustrates the omens of soothsayers, foils wizards, turns diviners into fools and makes wise men give wrong decisions. In summation the prophet says that the one and only God will have Cyrus shepherd his flock and give order to rebuild the nation of Israel.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 44:14</h3>
