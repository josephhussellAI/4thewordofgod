<p>Hezekiah was the 12<sup>th</sup> king of Judah, son of Ahaz an idolator. He came to the throne in the 25<sup>th</sup> year of his life and he is at this time 39 years old. He is told by his physicians that the disease is fatal. The prophet Isaiah tells the king to set his house in order (write a will) the greatest consideration was that he was childless─now he will leave this world without a successor to become king. He prays for God to have mercy upon him. God sent Isaiah to reveal the good news that 15 years would be added to his life and he would be permitted to enter the temple in three days and would not be childless. Hezekiah wants a sign─the shadow on the steps went back ten degrees. Hezekiah writes a poem about his healing.</p>

<h2>Exploring the Divine Miracle of Hezekiah’s Added Years</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 38:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Setting one’s house in order</strong> is writing a will or a living trust in which your affairs are decided before the funeral. It is there to give your last instructions.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>2Ch 32:24</strong> In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</li>
<li><strong>2Sa 17:23</strong> And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</li>
<li>Read: <strong>2Ki 20:1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</blockquote>
<p>Hezekiah's couch was probably placed in a corner, which is the place of honour in the East; in which, turning on either side, he must turn his face to the wall; by which he would withdraw himself from those attending him in his apartment.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psa 50:15</strong> And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</li>
<li><strong>Mat 6:6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</blockquote>
<p>While he is in death’s waiting room, he weeps and cries painful tears. His plea was based upon absolute devotion to God─loyal service and living honestly and heartily. He had destroyed images and other forms of idol worship, including the brazen serpent, he repaired the temple and its furniture, he held a great Passover and many other great things were accomplished during his reign. In this prayer he wants God to remember how he walked before him.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>2Ch 31:20-21</strong> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God. And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</blockquote>
<p>God speaks the second time to Isaiah about the state of the king.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>1Ki 9:4-5</strong> And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:5</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah is told that it’s a message from the God of David. God had listened to the plea of Hezekiah and responds with a new start that he has an additional 15 years.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>2Ch 32:22</strong> Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</li>
<li><strong>2Ti 4:17</strong> Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</blockquote>
<p>I am going to save both you and this city from the hands of the king of Assyria.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 37:35</strong> For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:7</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;</blockquote>
<p>Hezekiah is asking for a confirming sign that he will be healed─go up to the house of God on the third day.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isa 38:22</strong> Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?</li>
<li><strong>Isa 7:11</strong> Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</li>
<li><strong>Jdg 6:17</strong> And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.</li>
<li><strong>2Ki 20:8</strong> And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:8</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</blockquote>
<p>This was a staircase with steps marking the hours of the day─a tower was erected that bisected the sun and caused it to leave a shadow on the step that contained the time of day. This was indeed a miracle and only God can tell how it was performed. I am not falling for the bogus internet story about people at NASA discovering the missing time. That story has been debunked.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jos 10:13-14</strong> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</li>
<li><strong>2Ki 20:11</strong> And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.</li>
<li><strong>2Ch 32:24</strong> In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:10</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.</blockquote>
<p>It was in the prime of his life that he was being robbed of the normal years. He hadn’t celebrated his 40<sup>th</sup> birthday yet.</p>

<li><strong>Ecc 9:5-6</strong> For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:12</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</blockquote>
<p>My life is cut off like a rug from the loom. He was suffering night and day and he knew that his life was like a brittle thread.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psa 89:45-47</strong> The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</li>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</blockquote>
<p>Day and night he was given over to suffering─he felt like a man who had been mauled by a lion. The agony of certain kinds of fever gives the feeling of breaking ones bones.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>1Ki 13:24</strong> And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.</li>
<li><strong>1Ki 20:36</strong> Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isaiah 38:14</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</blockquote>
<p>He was delirious, and his words were inaudible─his speech was like the moan of a dove, or the chattering of a swallow, or the squawking of a doomed chicken. He couldn’t sleep─too upset and troubled and racked with pain.</p>
<h4>Cross References</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psa 102:4-7</strong> My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</blockquote>

<h4>Cross References</h4>
