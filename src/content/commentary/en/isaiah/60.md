<p>Israel was to rise, shine in splendor. Darkness as black as night was to cover the rest of the world. Their hearts and minds were darkened because of blindness. From Zion rays of light flowed to other nations. Their sons and grandchildren were brought back by their captors. Merchants from around the world would be trading with Israel. Caravans and traders from Sheba and Midian came with their wares for trade, tribal leaders from Kedar brought sacrifices to Jerusalem. Ships sail into the ports like clouds—vessels from the islands, and ships from Spain are bringing their sons and daughters home with a cargo of trade. Foreigners will help in their building projects.</p>
<p>Israel’s gates were open for tourists and trade. The gates shall be open continually means that they were closed at night for protection and opened in the day for visitors and trade. See the books of Nehemiah and Ezra for the building of these gates and how they were guarded. Cyrus, king of Persia, made a decree that bullocks, rams, lambs, wheat, salt, wine, oil, and tribute be brought to the Jews that were rebuilding Jerusalem and in the decree declared that any nation refusing to do so would be destroyed. This decree is found in Ezra 6:3-12. Zion is a boom town and no longer despised. She is called, “the city of the LORD.” Zion had been an animal sanctuary for 70 years, and is now being inhabited and a joy to all nations. Israel was trading on the world market—brass for gold—iron for silver—stones for iron. The good news was the lack of violence and border security. Their days of mourning were over—a new day had arrived—they were walking in the light of the LORD. As long as God’s people would do good and live right the land would remain theirs forever. God had planted them in their homeland like a garden in springtime. The prophet forecasts a population explosion. More insight is in the commentary section.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.</blockquote>

Behold, I was left alone; these, where <em>had</em> they <em>been?</em> Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in <em>their</em> arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon <em>their</em> shoulders.</li>
