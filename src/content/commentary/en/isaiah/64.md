<p>They wanted God to rip the skies open and come down like he did at Mt. Sinai. Mountains would shutter and oceans boil. What a God we have and what miracles he can do&#9472;He is about ready for another awesome act&#9472;this one will be greater than the opening of the Red Sea&#9472;It&rsquo;s all about opening prisons and rivers in deserts&#9472;all about a nation coming home from prison.</p>
<p>It was about nation building. The real question was about their sin. They were polluted, rotten and infected with unrightness. Were they hopeless? They were ready for the <strong>potter to reshape their lives</strong>. Their sacred places had been torn down and destroyed by the heathen, and Zion was a ghost town, overgrown with brush, nettles, briers and weeds. How long before God would rend the heavens and do something and how long will God keep quiet? They spoke their minds and said, &ldquo;are you just going to stand there and be silent and keep punishing us?&rdquo;</p>
