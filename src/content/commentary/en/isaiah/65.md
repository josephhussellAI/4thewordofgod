<p>Gentiles had not sought after God but now they are seeking him. They hadn’t bothered to ask but now they want the only God and God says here I am. Twenty-four seven God had called Israel but they just ignored him. They insulted God to his face with idols. They even tried night séances in the grave yard. Their witches brew religion infuriated God. They violated the Ten Commandments and now God was going to make them pay for it─this punishment would continue unto the 3rd generation.</p>
<p>God leaves a seed (remnant), God promises the elect lush fields for their flocks in Sharon, and their cattle in the valley of Achor. Those who had forsaken the LORD were destined for the sword and the legacy they leave would be cursed words. But the true servants would eat and drink well. The former hardships would be forgotten and their troubles would be over. They were coming back to Jerusalem with shouting and joy. Their “heaven on earth” had arrived. Long life expectancy was promised to the remnant. They will build, plant, harvest and enjoy life. Wolves and lambs will live together.</p>

<li><strong>Lev 26:3-10:</strong> If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

<h3>Isaiah 65:25</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</blockquote>
<p>In those days wolf and lamb, lion and bullock, will dwell together. Daniel has a lion with eagle’s wings and a leopard with a fowl’s wings and four heads in Dan. 7, which represented the kingdom of Persia and Greece. When kingdoms stopped acting like animals and laid down their arms and become peaceful with their neighbors it could be said that the wolf was laying down with the lamb. When Israel returned from captivity wolf and lamb, lion and bullock are dwelling together. In the scriptures a lion with four wings represented Babylon and it receives a heart transplant (heart of a man) and becomes human. Persia is represented under the image of a bear with three ribs in its mouth. (She had eaten up Lydia, Babylon and Egypt), Greece was represented as a leopard with four wings of a fowl.</p>
<p>Isa. 14:29 “Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.” Ahaz is dead but out of this serpent’s root (Ahaz), a snake will come (Hezekiah) and from his roots will come a fiery flying serpent (Manasseh). Even though the rod is broken his son will be a worse scourge than his father and out of him will come a fiery flying serpent. This King of Israel (Manasseh) was represented as a flying fiery serpent, (he was always flying off the handle and had a hot temper) Israel was represented as sheep. Jesus was represented as a Lion and a lamb. Herod was the fox and false teachers were represented as wolves. Babylon was represented as a dragon or a serpent. Ethiopia was represented as flies. Egypt was represented as the crocodile of the Nile. Syria was represented as bees and hornets. Jacob was represented as a worm. In Jer. 50:17 the king of Assyria is called a lion and the king of Babylon is also called a Lion. In Isa 56:11 Israel’s shepherds are called greedy dogs.</p>
<p>Finally, let me point out to you that we name our ball clubs hornets, dolphins, wolves, bears and beavers. In conclusion, it was no strange thing that wolves and lambs were eating together, (a peace pact was made between nations) lions were eating with oxen.. Snakes were eating dust and not biting their children. After careful examination of the scriptures you will arrive at this conclusion: Israel has returned from captivity and Persia rules the world and all the nations were under this one world government and so the wolf was dwelling with the lamb and the leopard was lying down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and dust is the serpent’s meat. In todays language; we might say of two ball clubs that the Jaguars were having dinner with the rams. Peace had finally arrived and Israel (Lamb) was lying down with Persia (bear). See Daniel chapter 7.</p>
