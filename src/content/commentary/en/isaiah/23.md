<p>Tyre was one of the two greatest cities in the world. As great in that day as N.Y. or London of our day. Tyre was situated midway between the east and the west, and at the junction of three continents, they carried on the trade of the world. The Mediterranean became the mere highway of their commerce. They passed the Strait of Gibraltar on one hand, and reached India on the other. They settled Cyprus, Sicily, and Sardinia. In Spain they founded Gades (now Cadiz); and in Africa, Utica and Carthage, the latter destined to be in time the dreaded rival of Rome. They planted depots on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. They obtained tin from The British Isles, amber from the Baltic, silver from Tarshish (southern Spain) and gold from southeastern Arabia. They carried on vast mining operations, and were marvelous workers in ivory, pottery, and the metals, so that their bronzes and painted vases became the models of early Grecian art. Sidon was noted for its glass working, in which the blowpipe, lathe, and graver were used. The costly purple dye of Tyre, obtained in minute drops from shellfish, was famous, the rarest and most beautiful shade being worn only by kings.</p>
<p>For years the armed forces of other nations had attacked this proud city but always unsuccessful. Very soon after this prophecy there was a 13-year siege by Nebuchadnezzar. (See Josephus) Nebuchadnezzar took the city, demolished the mainland. The people fled to the island located ½ mile off shore. Cf. 27:4; 28:2. The mainland became known as Old Tyre and the island as New Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar made himself master of Tyre, after a siege of thirteen years continuance, and utterly destroyed the place, that is, the city which was on the continent; the ruins of which were afterwards called Palae Tyrus, or Old Tyre. But, before it came to this extremity, the inhabitants had removed most of their effects into an island about half a mile distant from the shore, and there built them a new city.</p>
<p>And therefore, when Nebuchadnezzar entered that, which he had so long besieged, he found little there wherewith to reward his soldiers in the spoil of the place, which they had so long labored to take; and therefore wreaking his anger upon the buildings, and the few inhabitants who were left in them, he razed the whole town to the ground, and slew all he found therein. After this it never more recovered it former glory; but the city on the island became the Tyre that was afterward so famous by that name; the other on the continent never arising any higher than to become a village by the name of Old Tyre, as was before said. (Prideaux’s Connection 1676 Page 127)</p>
<p>Today, a small new town called Sur in a different location out in the Peninsula and inhabited by a few fisherman. It is erroneously designated as Tyre by some maps, but is not Tyre. It is not on the sight of Ancient Tyre. Ancient Tyre has never been rebuilt. It was predicted that Tyre would be forgotten for 70 years. Jer. 25:11,12.</p>
<blockquote>“This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt," declares the LORD, "and will make it desolate forever.”</blockquote>
<p>She served the Babylonians for 70 years afterwards she rebuilt Tyre on the Island. Isa. 23:15-17</p>
<blockquote>“At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute: "Take up a harp, walk through the city, O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered." At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.”</blockquote>
<p>In the year 606 B.C. King Nebuchadnezzar had invaded the nation of Judah. The Jews were conquered and taken captive to Babylon between 606 and 580 BC. The people of Tyre were looking with greedy eyes upon Judah, and they were making plans on going down and taking part of the spoil now that their rival king had invaded and conquered it.</p>
<p>250 years later, Alexander the Great accomplished the reduction of Tyre. He built a causeway 200 feet wide and ½ mile long to the island. Thus turning the island into a peninsula scaled the wall and conquered the people. After a siege of 7 months the city was captured, 8,000 citizens were slaughtered, 2,000 crucified and 30,000 sold into slavery. Alexander performed a feet of military ingenuity by building a 2,000 ft, mole in the sea. To safeguard operations, mobile protective shields, so called ‘tortoises’ had to be employed. Despite this the construction was greatly hindered by and incessant hail of missiles.</p>
<p>Meantime engineers on shore were building mobile protective towers many stories high. They were the highest siege towers ever used in the history of war. A drawbridge on front enabled a surprise attack to be made on the enemy’s wall. Each of them was one hundred and sixty feet high. When these monsters were prepared they were rolled toward the walls of Tyre. The impregnable Tyre met with fate at Alexander’s hand.</p>
<p>Josephus places the settlement of Tyre 240 years before the building of Solomon’s Temple. Pliney, who wrote when its boundaries could still be traced, computes the circuit of Palae-Tyrus and the island together at nineteen Roman miles. Tyre offered a qualified surrender to Alexander the Great, which did not satisfy the haughty Macedonian, and he instantly laid siege to the city. Having no adequate fleet with which to reach the island-town, he resolved to carry a causeway across the channel, which separated the island from Old Tyre, on the mainland, and he demolished the buildings of the latter to provide materials for the work. It was an undertaking of immense magnitude and difficulty, and the ingenious Tyreians found many modes of interfering with it.</p>
<p>They succeeded in destroying the mole when half of it had been built; but Alexander, with obstinate perseverance, began his work anew, on a larger scale than before. He also collected a strong fleet of war-galleys, from Cyprus and from the Phoenicians who had submitted to him, with which the opposition of the enemy was checked and his own operations advanced. (History for Ready Reference 1895 Vol 5 p. 3159-3160)</p>
<p>The prophets not only foretold the overthrow of old Tyre, but also of this new city, built, as it were, “in the midst of the sea.” Ezek 27:32 “As they wail and mourn over you, they will take up a lament concerning you: ‘Who was ever silenced like Tyre, surrounded by the sea?’” Isaiah makes it clear that Tyre was located on an island when he says: “Howl ye inhabitants of the isle.” Isa 23:6 “Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.”</p>
<p>Zechariah says that Tyre heaped up gold and silver like dirt on the streets and that she was a sea power and would be consumed by fire. Zech 9:3,4 “Tyre has built herself a stronghold; she has heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets. But the Lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea, and she will be consumed by fire.” This new city was truly a strong hold, for not only was her walls 150 feet in height but she was located on an island a half mile from shore making it impossible for other nations to attack her. Ezekiel also plainly predicts, that the second destruction of Tyre should be by fire. Ezek 28:18. By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.</p>
<p>“Accordingly, Alexander the Great besieged and took the city, and set it on fire. Alexander’s Evidences of Christianity, 1836 p 155 (Professor at Princeton Seminary) Cotovicus, a Dutch traveler, who visited Syria in 1598, writes, “that this city so often restored after being overthrown, now at length appears to be utterly ruined; so that it has ceased to be any longer a city, and only some inconsiderable vestiges of her former ruins are now visible. If you except a few arches and baths, and some ruined walls, and collapsed towers, and mere rubbish, there is now nothing of Tyre to be discerned.” Quoted in Alexander’s Evidences of Christianity, 1836 p. 156</p>
<p>“This city, standing in the sea, on a peninsula, at a distance, promises something very magnificent; but when you come nearer, you find no similitude of that glory for which it was so renowned in ancient times, and which the prophet Ezekiel describes in chapters 26,27,28 of his prophecy. On the north side, it has an old ungarrisoned Turkish castle, besides which you see nothing but a mere Babel of broken walls, pillars, vaults, etc. there being not so much as one entire house left; its present inhabitants only a few poor wretches, harboring themselves in the vaults, and subsisting chiefly on fishing, who seem to be preserved in this place, by divine Providence, as a visible argument how God has fulfilled his word concerning Tyre, that it should be ‘as the top of a rock, a place for fishers to dry their nets on.’” Quoted in Alexander’s Evidences of Christianity, 1836 p. 157</p>
<p>Now for my commentary on the destruction of Tyre according to the Scriptures.</p>

<h2>Unveiling the Prophetic Judgment of the Merchant City</h2>

<h3>Isaiah 23:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</blockquote>
<p>According to the Sovereign Lord they are going to tear down her walls and take a sledgehammer to her towers and leave nothing but a bare rock where fishermen will dry their nets. The Babylonians besieged Tyre for 13 years and finally broke through her stronghold and began their destruction. But Tyre had fled, along with all her riches to an island a half-mile off shore. The Babylonians had no way of reaching them. As a reward for carrying out the siege the Sovereign Lord tell Nebuchadnezzar that he will give him Egypt as a reward. “Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as pay for his army. I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army did it for me, declares the Sovereign LORD.” Ezekiel 29:19,20</p>

<h3>Isaiah 23:2</h3>

<p>Notice how the word of God mentions mainland and island. All her subdivisions, villages, and sister towns will be destroyed by the sword and when it happens they will know that it was of God. This was all accomplished by the army of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.</blockquote>
<p>You bought slaves and bronze dishes from the merchants of Greece, Tubal, and Meshech. Anyone in need of a slave could purchase one in the slave market at Tyre. Bronze is the only metal that will last where salt water is present. Therefore, all the lights, oarlocks, bolts, navigational equipment, nails and miscellaneous hardware on the ships or located in the harbors were made of bronze. Armenian feudal Lords supplied you with horses, horsemen and mules. A barter type of trade was carried on so that caravans would come loaded with goods and leave loaded with goods from other countries that came through the port of Tyre.</p>
<p>The men of Dedan (Rhodes) traded with you. The coastlines and islands were a source of your commerce. Places in which you done business gave you ivory tusks and ebony. Syria was another of her merchants. They traded turquoise, purple dyes, fine linen, and jewelry. Judah and Israel traded wheat, wax, olive oil, and honey. Farmers from Israel shipped their produce up to Tyre. Danites and Greeks traded you wrought iron, sugarcane, cinnamon and spices. Danites were from the tribe of Dan. Uzal is now Yemen it was located on the Tygris river and was famous for sword blades. Dedan traded their expensive saddle blankets with you. By now you are beginning to see that Tyre was a world import and export city. Dedan is Ethopia.</p>

<p>This sea-going trade capital was headed for disaster. Alexander will come from the East. 250 years after this prophecy, Alexander the Great accomplished the reduction of Tyre. He built a causeway 200 feet wide and ½ mile long to the island. Thus turning the island into a peninsula scaled the wall and conquered the people. After a siege of 7 months the city was captured, 8,000 citizens were slaughtered, 2,000 crucified and 30,000 sold into slavery.</p>

According to prophecy Tyre was to be “broken in the heart of the sea.” When Alexander arrived Tyre was not on land but in the heart of the sea. Was there ever a prophecy fulfilled with such accuracy and detail.</p>

<p>Their countenance has changed, they are horrified and appalled and are aghast at their fate, this people was so panic-stricken that it showed it on their face. Doom has come to the people of Tyre. Alexander will capture 40,000 citizens of Tyre, 8,000 citizens will be slaughtered, 2,000 will be crucified and 30,000 will be sold as slaves. Is it any wonder that the scripture says that their kings shudder with horror and faces are distorted with fear.</p>

<h3>Isaiah 23:14</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.</blockquote>
<p>A fleet of ships from Tarshish (Spain) came filled to the brim with merchandise and left with a load of cargo to other seaports. Now their source of exports and trading has come to an end. Here is a brief description of how the final blow happened. Alexander the Great accomplished the reduction of Tyre. He built a causeway 200 feet wide and ½ mile long to the island. Thus turning the island into a peninsula scaled the wall and conquered the people. After a siege of 7 months the city was captured, 8,000 citizens were slaughtered, 2,000 crucified and 30,000 sold into slavery. Alexander performed a feet of military ingenuity by building a 2,000 ft, mole in the sea. To safeguard operations, mobile protective shields, so called ‘tortoises’ had to be employed. Despite this the construction was greatly hindered by and incessant hail of missiles. Meantime engineers on shore were building mobile protective towers many stories high. They were the highest siege towers ever used in the history of war. A drawbridge on front enabled a surprise attack to be made on the enemy’s wall. Each of them was one hundred and sixty feet high. When these monsters were prepared they were rolled toward the walls of Tyre. The impregnable Tyre met with fate at Alexander’s hand. According to prophecy Tyre was to be “broken in the heart of the sea.” When Alexander arrived Tyre was not on land but in the heart of the sea. Was there ever a prophecy fulfilled with such accuracy and detail.</p>

<p>She served the Babylonians for 70 years afterwards she rebuilt Tyre on the Island. Isa. 23:15-17 “At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute: "Take up a harp, walk through the city, O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered." At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar made himself master of Tyre, after a siege of thirteen years continuance, and utterly destroyed the place, that is, the city which was on the continent; the ruins of which were afterwards called Palae Tyrus, or Old Tyre. But, before it came to this extremity, the inhabitants had removed most of their effects onto an island about half a mile distant from the shore, and there built them a new city. And therefore, when Nebuchadnezzar entered that, which he had so long besieged, he found little there wherewith to reward his soldiers in the spoil of the place, which they had so long labored to take; and therefore wreaking his anger upon the buildings, and the few inhabitants who were left in them, he razed the whole town to the ground, and slew all he found therein.</p>
<p>After this it never more recovered it former glory; but the city on the island became the Tyre that was afterward so famous by that name; the other on the continent never arising any higher than to become a village by the name of Old Tyre, as was before said.
