<p>Come with me and I will introduce you to the harlot. She is drunk (not with intoxicants, but with the blood of saints). She is on a scarlet colored beast. No one can take a picture of her hierarchy without seeing this color. The Catholic church has blasphemed and held out a cup luring people into sin by her indulgences. The ten kingdoms of Europe helped the Catholic church who opposed God's people. Many people were bamboozled and hoodwinked by this religion of whom God declares does not have eternal life. It was such a riddle and mystery that even the apostle wondered with great admiration.</p><p>John tells us that the beast he saw was the ten kingdoms of Europe and that they would give the Catholic church their power for a period of time and then hate her. She would make war with the Lamb and his followers but in the final analysis the ten kingdoms of Europe would finally bring her down. God's word was and is being fulfilled. Alleluia.</p><p>Daniel the Prophet declared, <em>&quot;And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of times&quot;</em> (Dan 7:25). She claims the power to make and unmake kings. She changed the laws respecting the Lord's Supper. She set up images. In 1075 Pope Gregory VII declared all clerical marriages invalid. This was the greatest mass divorce in history. She changed times and laws. She changed our calendar. In 1518 Pope Gregory changed our calendar ten days. She changed the 10 commandments. In general she claims absolute control of all religion. The last verse of the chapter tells us that the <strong>&quot;Woman&quot;</strong> is a <strong>&quot;City&quot;</strong> which rules over the earth. If this isn't ROME, then please tell me what city he had in mind.</p><h2>Uncovering the Mystery of the Great Whore and Babylon</h2><h3>Revelation 17:1</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, &quot;Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters.</blockquote><p>What a word picture. The scripture represents her under the image of a corrupt, idolatrous, and abandon woman. This city reigns over the kings of the earth. Scholars are universally agreed that the city is ROME. Those familiar with Old Testament prophecy will know how often the term &quot;fornication&quot; and &quot;adultery&quot; are used to describe unfaithfulness of a city.</p><blockquote>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her-- but now murderers! (ISA 1:21)</blockquote><blockquote>Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, ‘I will not serve you!’ Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute. (JER 2:20)</blockquote><blockquote>‘If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man, should he return to her again? Would not the land be completely defiled? But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers–would you now return to me?’ declares the Lord. (JER 3:1)</blockquote><p>Verse 15 explains that &quot;many waters&quot; are &quot;peoples and multitudes, and nations, and tongues,&quot; over which she rules.</p><h3>Revelation 17:2</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.&quot;</blockquote><p>The Kings of the earth aligned themselves with the Roman Catholic Church and became partners with her. Nations were so intoxicated with her power that they could not see the truth. She is still deceiving millions today. Chapter eighteen, verse 23 declares that, <em>&quot;by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.&quot;</em> Could anything be more plain?</p><h3>Revelation 17:3</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.</blockquote><p>Lets look at some of the claims of the Pope's and see if they are blasphemous.</p><ol><li>He claims to be head of the church. How can this be in the light of Scripture. <em>&quot;And he (Christ) is the head of the body, the church...&quot;</em> (Col 1:18). What blasphemy it is for any mortal man to claim what belongs only to God.</li><li>The Pope claims that he is the Judge of the Living and the Dead (Cath. Ency. XV. page 126). This is some more of his blasphemy. The Scriptures teach just the opposite (2 Tim. 4:1).</li><li>Authority above all and subject to none (Pius VI Ency. 65). Some more of their great swelling words. Doesn't sound like the teachings of the Bible (Romans 13:1).</li><li>We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty (Leo. XIII Ency, 304). You can't find a more blasphemous statement than that. No wonder God calls her <strong>&quot;MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&quot;</strong> (Rev. 17:5).</li><li>The Vicar of Christ (Cath. Dic. 258). The Pope has this inscription on his crown <strong>VICARIVS FILII DEI</strong>. Translated this means Vicar of Son of God. It is interesting to learn that when we add up the Roman numerical values of this inscription we have: V=5, I=1, C=100, A=0, R=0, I=1, V=5, S=0; F=0, I=1, L=50, I=1, I=1; D=500, E=0, I=1. Totaling <strong>666</strong>.</li><li>He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.</li></ol><p>I offer the following quotes from official Catholic books to prove that she fulfills that which was spoken by Paul in II Thess. 2:4, <em>&quot;He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshipped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.&quot;</em></p><h3>Revelation 17:4</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.</blockquote><p>The Catholic church has untold wealth. Nino Lo Bello says, &quot;on the question, How rich is the Pope?, suffice it to say that it has become increasingly clear he doesn't even know himself.&quot; Again he says it is &quot;one of the greatest fiscal powers in the world.&quot; [The Vatican Empire, p.8]. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. She makes large offers and absolutions, and positively lures men into sin.</p><h3>Revelation 17:5</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">This title was written on her forehead: MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</blockquote><p>Her doctrine of purgatory, transubstantiation, relics, miracles, signs, sacraments, etc. are all mysterious and unfathomable. It is mysterious how anyone could be so zealous and profess to be Christian and practice these sins.</p><h3>Revelation 17:6</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.</blockquote><p>Consider: Persecutions and death of Waldenses, Popes war against the Albigenses (Bohemian Brethren), Massacre of St. Bartholomew, Martyrdom of John Calas, the Inquisition (150,000 in 30 years), John Wycliffe, John Huss, Jerome of Prague, Tyndale, Luther, Persecutions in Germany, France, Scotland, England, Ireland, persecution of Quakers. From the order of the Jesuits of 1540 it is supposed that 900,000 persons have perished through papal cruelty. Dear reader do you think she is drunk on the blood of Saints? Is there any other institution on the face of the earth that more likely fits the above description?</p><h3>Revelation 17:7-9</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then the angel said to me: &quot;Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns... This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.</blockquote><p>When you first read the history of Roman Catholicism you will wonder with great admiration, you will be amazed beyond measure. Her acts will astound and perplex you beyond measure. I have her own books, and encyclopedias written by her own priests. God has made her confess her own sins. Rome sits on seven hills, thus the seven-hilled city is a representation of the seven forms of government that she has passed through.</p><h3>Revelation 17:10</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while.</blockquote><p>The remaining part of the book will talk extensively about this red dragon. It is therefore necessary that we identify who or what he is. In Daniel chapter two he speaks of four Kingdoms and identifies them as Babylon, Media Persia, Greece and the fourth as the Roman Empire. It is stated in both Daniel and the Revelation that this Empire would have seven heads. As we examine the Empire we notice that it passed through seven Heads:</p><ol><li>It was ruled over by seven kings for about 200 years.</li><li>Consuls</li><li>Tribunes</li><li>Decemvirs</li><li>Dictators</li><li>65 Emperors ruled in Rome for 5 centuries.</li><li>Exarchs of Ravenna ruled for more than a century.</li></ol><p>This 7 headed beast has 10 horns, or ten Kings (kingdoms) over which she ruled for 1260 years. We identify them as the ten kingdoms of Europe:</p><ol><li>German empire</li><li>Austrian Empire</li><li>Belgium</li><li>Holland</li><li>France</li><li>Spain</li><li>Italy</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Portugal</li><li>Great Britain</li></ol><h3>Revelation 17:11-13</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction...</blockquote><ul><li>The Beast <em>was</em> when Rome was in power.</li><li>The Beast <em>was not</em> when Rome fell.</li><li>The Beast &quot;<em>yet is</em>&quot; when it reappeared in Roman Catholicism.</li></ul><p>Out of the seventh head of the Roman Empire (the Exarchs of Ravenna) who ruled for a short time (about a century) came the eighth king (the Pope) who is going into perdition. At the time that this book was written none of these ten kings or kingdoms had received power. This verse affirms that when John was here that Europe was not divided into ten kingdoms. These powers aided the false church in her religious wars. During the dark ages she used these Kings and their armies to destroy heretics (Christians).</p><h3>Revelation 17:14</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.</blockquote><p>Rome's long history was marked with the shedding of the blood of saints. Can anyone doubt that this belongs to the Popes. In 1208 Pope Innocent III warred against the Waldenses and Albigenses, in which one million perished. From the beginning of the Jesuits 1540-1580 nine hundred thousand were destroyed. One hundred fifty thousand perished by the inquisition in thirty years. The historian W.E. H. Lecky says, &quot;The church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who has a complete knowledge of history.&quot;</p><h3>Revelation 17:16</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.</blockquote><p>All of the ten kingdoms of Europe finally turned against the Pope and withdrew their power. Consider the following: France was considered the “eldest son of the church,” she turned against the church and invaded Italy and locked the Pope up in Prison. Read the history of the French Revolution and see how they hated the Catholic church for its sins.</p><h3>Revelation 17:18</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.</blockquote><p>No King was made or unmade in all the ten kingdoms of Europe without the will of the pope of Rome. He claimed the right to transfer sovereignties, break scepters, and remove crowns. All of this shows how arrogant the Catholic Church was during the dark ages and how she ruled over the ten kingdoms of Europe. This power that once ruled the world has now been broken, Alleluia.</p>
