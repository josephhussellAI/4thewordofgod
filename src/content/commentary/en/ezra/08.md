<p>They are on their 900-mile journey to the homeland of their fathers when the roster was looked at and Ezra saw that no Levites were among them. Ezra realized that the worship would be hamstrung without these men. So, they remained camping at <strong>Ahava Canal</strong> for 3 days while Ezra sent some of his staff to Iddo in Casiphia to help find some Levites. They prayed and fasted for a safe journey which would take a little more than 3 months. God heard their prayer. Twelve leaders from among the priests were in charge of the safe arrival of silver and gold etc. They were to guard it with their life.</p>
<p>On the 8th of April BC 458 they broke camp and started the long journey from the Ahava Canal. Upon arrival they rested 3 days and on the 4th day deposited the valuables in the temple and entrusted it with those in charge. The exiles sacrificed burnt offerings and a copy of the king’s decrees was delivered to Governors in Trans-Euphrates. Upon reading the decree these Governors then cooperated by supplying the aforementioned materials.</p>

<h2>The Return to Jerusalem</h2>

<h3>Ezra 8:15</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.</blockquote>
<p>Ezra encounters the same problem as Zerubbabel. Only 74 Levites came back with Zerubbabel so the priests are short of assistants. Ezra delays the caravan till a search could be made for Levites to accompany them.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:16</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,</blockquote>
<p>These chief men and the learned men are sent on a mission to find Levites.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:17</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">and I sent them to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his kinsmen, the temple servants in Casiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God.</blockquote>
<p>Iddo was probably what we call a town manager and they take a strong message from Ezra to help find some Levites. <strong>Casiphia</strong> was located on the Tigris River north of Babylon.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:18</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah's sons and brothers, 18 men;</blockquote>
<p>Ezra believes that it is by divine providence of God that their prayers were answered. God even supplied them a bonus—a man of understanding and eighteen recruits.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:19</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 men.</blockquote>
<p>Twenty more recruits—Ezra’s men have thirty Levites that will join the caravan to Jerusalem.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:20</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.</blockquote>
<p>220 more assistants join the caravan.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:21</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.</blockquote>
<p>They prayed and fasted for a safe and prosperous journey.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:22</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him."</blockquote>
<p>Ezra was a man of great faith, he believed that God would not let their journey fail. Ezra had told the king of his trust in the Almighty God so now he was ashamed to ask for an army escort of cavalry.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:23</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</blockquote>
<p>They again fast and pray for their trip and God listened and supplied.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:24</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,</blockquote>
<p>Ezra chose 12 leading priests to be the brinks bank.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:25</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.</blockquote>
<p>All of the treasures were counted and listed so that at the end of the journey the inventory list will show that none of the valuables are missing.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:26</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,</blockquote>
<p>This is an enormous amount of silver and gold and it was worth millions of dollars. Their job was not only to handle all loading and unloading from the pack animals but to make sure that it was guarded 24/7.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:27</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.</blockquote>
<p>These polished bowls and fine articles will be wrapped and handled with extreme care as prized possessions. Thus far we can see that Ezra was an excellent organizer and guide. He is in charge of the entire caravan.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:28</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">I said to them, "You as well as these articles are consecrated to the LORD. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.</blockquote>
<p>Ezra tells the men in charge that they are holy men and are entrusted with holy things. He impressed upon them that this was more than just a job—they were entrusted with God’s treasure.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:29</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel."</blockquote>
<p>Ezra further instructs them to guard them carefully and that accountings will he made at the temple in Jerusalem.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:30</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.</blockquote>
<p>So the Priests and Levites are the guards appointed over the precious valuables.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:31</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.</blockquote>
<p>The 12th day of the first month corresponds to our April 8th of our calendar.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:32</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.</blockquote>
<p>The hand of God by his providence led them safely through dangerous territory. The long journey of about 900 miles taking 119 days leaves them weary so they rest 3 days before any un-crating or finding a new home.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:33</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.</blockquote>
<p>On day four which will be August 8th they unpack, uncrate and weigh all the gold and silver and count everything. It was a full inventory and everything was accounted for.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:34</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.</blockquote>
<p>A full scale inventory was made—numbers and weight corresponded with the original inventory. Everything was accounted for.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:35</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.</blockquote>
<p>They have a worship service—more like a thanksgiving service—praising and thanking God for the safe and prosperous journey.</p>

<h3>Ezra 8:36</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">They also delivered the king's orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.</blockquote>
<p>They took the kings decree of chapter seven and gave a copy to all the governors of the Trans-Euphrates area. As you may recall this decree will tell all the governors to furnish all of the building materials, food and any and all expenses related to the building of the house of God.</p>
