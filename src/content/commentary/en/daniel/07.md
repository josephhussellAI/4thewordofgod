<p>Out of the sea of humanity, a storm is brewing. It is not a tornado or heavy rain but a political unrest resulting in the rise and fall of political regimes. In this chapter, there are four beasts (kingdoms that acted like beasts). The four animals—lion, bear, leopard, and a nondescript animal—represent four kingdoms. When Daniel wrote his prophecy, only one of the kingdoms was in existence, but with the telescope of prophecy, he unveils the future of world history. The <strong>lion</strong> represented the Babylonian empire, while the <strong>bear</strong> represented Medo-Persia, and the <strong>leopard</strong> represented Alexander the Great. The nondescript animal (which is called the <strong>fourth kingdom</strong>) represents the Roman Empire, and the <strong>little horn</strong> that came up out of the fourth empire represents the <strong>Papacy</strong>. This beast occupies the attention of Daniel more than any other because it would kill the saints, change God’s laws, blaspheme God, and finally, after twelve hundred and sixty years, lose its dominion.</p><h2>Deciphering the Prophecy of the Little Horn and Divine Judgment</h2><h3>Daniel 7:1</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</blockquote><p>In the year of 550 B.C., Daniel has a dream. He relates the dream in this chapter and gives the sum of the matter. We know that the beasts represent four kingdoms. Daniel tells us that the fourth beast is the fourth kingdom on earth; therefore, they are not to be taken as literal beasts but rather that these kingdoms acted like beasts.</p><h3>Daniel 7:2</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</blockquote><p>A great storm began to blow on the sea of humanity causing agitation, and out of this chaos arose four kingdoms. <strong>Four winds</strong> means from four directions: North, South, East, West.</p><p>It is evident that when the Bible uses the words "four corners, or four winds" that it means four directions. Winds as used are a sign of strife, confusion, commotions, destruction, turmoil, and war. In the passage here in Daniel, we are told that the four winds were to blow something in from the sea of humanity. Note how John uses the word waters in Revelation 17:15: "And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."</p><h3>Daniel 7:3</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</blockquote><p>Daniel sees the great sea of humanity stirred up and out of it four-world empires emerge. They were to be different from each other.</p><h3>Daniel 7:4</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</blockquote><p>The first of the four kingdoms was <strong>Babylon</strong> and is described as a Lion. On their inscriptions, they portrayed their kingdom under the image of a lion. A Lion is warlike, supreme in power, domination, and sovereignty. Daniel saw in his dream that the Lion (Babylon) would get its wings plucked off. In other words, he would no longer be able to move rapidly in conquest. The monarch would stand up like a man and be given a man's heart; he would be changed from ferocity to weakness.</p><h3>Daniel 7:5</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</blockquote><p>The second beast is described under the image of a <strong>Bear</strong>. This animal is distinguished mainly for cunning and ferocity. This kingdom was composed of the <strong>Medes and the Persians</strong>. She rose up on one side, that is, the Medes rose up first. She had three ribs in her mouth, representing three provinces devoured: <strong>Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt</strong>.</p><h3>Daniel 7:6</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</blockquote><p>The third kingdom is likened to a <strong>Leopard</strong>. This kingdom is <strong>Greece</strong>, under Alexander the Great. It had four wings of a fowl, denoting speed greater than the Lion. Upon the death of Alexander, the kingdom was divided among his four generals:</p><ul><li>Syria and the East under General Seleucus.</li><li>Bithynia and Thrace under General Lysimachus.</li><li>Egypt under General Ptolemy Sotor.</li><li>Macedonia under General Cassander.</li></ul><h3>Daniel 7:7</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</blockquote><p>This fourth kingdom is likened to a nondescript animal, representing the <strong>Roman Empire</strong>. The ten horns refer to the ten European governments that were within the Roman Empire. The ten kingdoms are listed by Sir Isaac Newton as follows:</p><ol><li>The kingdom of the Vandals and Alans in Spain and Africa.</li><li>The kingdom of the Suevians in Spain.</li><li>The Kingdom of the Visigoths.</li><li>The kingdom of the Alans in Gallia.</li><li>The Kingdom of the Burgundians.</li><li>The Kingdom of the Franks.</li><li>The Kingdom of the Britons.</li><li>The Kingdom of the Huns.</li><li>The Kingdom of the Lombards.</li><li>The Kingdom of the Ravenna.</li></ol><h3>Daniel 7:8</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</blockquote><p>The <strong>little horn</strong> is <strong>Popery</strong> that started in a small way but soon was able to wipe out three horns. Sir Isaac Newton lists the three horns that it wiped out as: "The Exarchate of Ravenna, the kingdom of the Lombards, and the Dukedom of Rome."</p><p>Lets look at the claims of the Popes and see if these "great swelling words" are not blasphemous:</p><ol><li>He claims to be head of the church.</li><li>The Pope claims that he is the Judge of the Living and the Dead.</li><li>The Pope claims authority above all and subject to none.</li><li>Pope Leo XIII said: "We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty."</li><li>The Pope claims to be The Vicar of Christ.</li></ol><p>The Pope has this inscription on his crown: <strong>VICARIVS FILII DEI</strong>. Translated this means Vicar of Son of God. The numerical values of this inscription total <strong>666</strong>.</p><h3>Daniel 7:9-10</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit... A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him... the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</blockquote><p>The Ancient of Days (God) convened court in Heaven. Since there is no higher court, there were no appeals. The books of her conduct were opened, and the Little Horn's crimes were laid before the august body.</p><h3>Daniel 7:11-12</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</blockquote><p>Daniel watches until the execution is carried out. This aligns with Paul's prophecy in 2 Thessalonians 2 regarding the "Wicked" being consumed by the Lord, and Revelation 19 regarding the beast cast into the lake of fire.</p><h3>Daniel 7:13-14</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven... And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom...</blockquote><p>This refers to the Ascension and Coronation of Jesus Christ. When Jesus returned to the Father, He received all power, dominion, and glory. The kingdoms set up by men have passed away, but the kingdom of Christ remains.</p><h3>Daniel 7:15-18</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this... These great beasts, which are four, are four kings... But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom...</blockquote><p>The truth is told to Daniel: The four beasts are four earthly kingdoms. However, the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, for it is the Father’s good pleasure to give the kingdom to the little flock (Luke 12:32).</p><h3>Daniel 7:19-22</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast... and of the ten horns... and of the other which came up... until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High...</blockquote><p>The fourth beast is the Imperial Roman Empire, out of which the Little Horn arises. History shows how the Papacy made war against the saints until the <strong>Protestant Reformation</strong>, when the Saints of the Most High were granted judgment from on High.</p><h3>Daniel 7:23-25</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth... And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</blockquote><p>The Little Horn (the Pope) speaks great words against the Most High, claiming infallibility and titles belonging only to God. The prophecy states he would "wear out the saints." Historians estimate that the persecuting hands of Rome have been reddened by the blood of millions of saints.</p><p>God says this would be given into her hand until a <strong>time and times and the dividing of time</strong> (1260 years). From the rise of the Papacy to the era of Napoleon Bonaparte, who took the pope prisoner, this prophecy was fulfilled.</p><h3>Daniel 7:26-28</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion... And the kingdom and dominion... shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High...</blockquote><p>God convened Heaven's Court, and the verdict was rendered that her dominion would be taken away. Today, freedom of religion has spread, and the tyranny of the Little Horn has ended. The kingdom is given to the Saints of the Most High.</p>
