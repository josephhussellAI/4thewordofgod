<p>God had sent prophet after prophet with stern warnings for Israel and Judea to reform but they were stiff necked and rebellious, so God chose a heathen nation to carry out his orders, namely, <strong>seventy years of captivity</strong>. About ninety percent of the population was either killed by war or massacred by the Babylonians and only those who were skilled or strong enough for hard labor were taken into slavery. The Babylonians captured Jerusalem and carried away civilians as war captivities and not one was ever released. Among the captivities was a young man by the name of Daniel. This chapter will tell us how he rose from a captive slave to a high government official in both kingdoms. For the next three years Daniel and his three companions will be oriented into the Babylonian culture and religion. They learn the language of the king’s court and will become servants in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar. Throughout the book you will see that God will bring them down and exalt the God of Israel.</p>

<h2>Uncovering Divine Wisdom Through the Trial by Food</h2>

<h3>Daniel 1:1</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</blockquote>
<p>In the year of <strong>606 B.C.</strong> Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem with his war machine. Babylon dates back to the time of Nimrod, and Genesis eleven gives us the story of the tower of Babel where the languages derived. This place was called Babel because people began to talk in different languages and it sounded like babbling, hence the word Babel. Babylon, the Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning “The Gate of God.” In the Assyrian tablets it means “The city of the dispersion of the tribes.” It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts.</p>
<p>On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The great mound called <strong>Babel</strong> by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Kasr</strong> (i.e., “the palace”). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound.</li>
  <li>A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called <strong>Amran ibn-Ali</strong>. This is probably the most ancient portion of the city’s remains. Where the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace.</li>
</ul>
<p>The utter desolation of the city once called “The glory of kingdoms” (Isaiah 13:19) was foretold by the prophets. This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon.</p>
<p>After three years of servitude to the Babylonians Jehoiakim decided to throw of the yoke, but Nebuchadnezzar would have none of this—so he invaded Judah again and burned the city.</p>
<p>Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon and was captured, all the nobles slain, his children massacred, he was bound in chains, his eyes gouged out with a dagger and the sockets were cauterized with a hot iron poker. They manacled him like a slave, iron rings were forged around the ankles and linked together by a six inch chain, and then a tight chain was placed around the waist, this was attached by a third chain in such a way that the prisoner could not run away. So, for 70 years they lived and died in a foreign land.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:2</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</blockquote>
<p>Jehoiakim was permitted to remain at Jerusalem, though tributary to the King of Babylon. Note that the “Lord gave” Jehoiakim into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. God’s reason for destroying Jerusalem is told in Jeremiah 17:24-27. He carried part of the vessels to his trophy house in Babylon on the first invasion. During the second invasion the remaining vessels were carried away. They were on display in the temple of Belus, and placed in the treasure house or as we would call it “the trophy room.”</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:3</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</blockquote>
<p>Ashpenaz was over all the servants in the palace. He was master of the eunuchs. There is no doubt that the prophets word was being fulfilled at that very moment (2 Ki. 20:14-19). Daniel and his three friends were of the King’s seed. But they were castrated so that there would be no more of their seed. The four young men are castrated. They are incapable of marriage or producing children because they are impotent. Their testicles are removed from the scrotum with no sterilized instruments and no anesthesia. It was brutal and inhumane but after all they did not have to answer to the Geneva Convention regarding war crimes.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:4</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</blockquote>
<p>The young men were strong, healthy and good looking. The king institutes a wise policy of using these young men in his kingdom. It appears that the dialect taught to the four Hebrews was the ancient <strong>Cushite language</strong> used for scientific and religious purposes. Thus, no one really knew this dialect except the learned, namely, the priests, magicians, and astrologers. Three years later they have passed all the grades with a 4.0. Now they are equipped and endowed with knowledge and wisdom.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:5</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</blockquote>
<p>They are the only ones of the exile that are so privileged. The law of Moses forbade the eating of unclean meats.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lev. 11:2</strong> - Beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts.</li>
  <li><strong>Lev. 11:4</strong> - Shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel.</li>
  <li><strong>Lev. 11:13-14</strong> - Fowls that are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray.</li>
  <li><strong>Acts 15:29</strong> - Abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daniel 1:6</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</blockquote>
<p>These four young men were probably 18 to 20 years old.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:7</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</blockquote>
<p>Ashpenaz probably had plenty of authority and therefore could rename the four Hebrews. He changes their names but could not change their character:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Daniel</strong></dt>
  <dd>Original meaning: "Judge of God". New Name: <strong>Belteshazzar</strong> ("Prince of bel").</dd>
  <dt><strong>Hananiah</strong></dt>
  <dd>Original meaning: "gift of the Lord". New Name: <strong>Shadrach</strong> ("servant of the moon god").</dd>
  <dt><strong>Mishael</strong></dt>
  <dd>Original meaning: "who is what God is". New Name: <strong>Meshach</strong> ("servant of the sun god by that name").</dd>
  <dt><strong>Azariah</strong></dt>
  <dd>Original meaning: "whom Jehovah helps". New Name: <strong>Abed-nego</strong> ("Servant of Nebo").</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Daniel 1:8</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</blockquote>
<p>Daniel could make friends easily and was skilled in the ability to handle a stressful situation. He kept everything smooth and pleasant, he had the ability to get things done.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:9</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</blockquote>
<p>Our “God” took a hand in the matter and made an exemption in the matter. Prince Melzar, who was in charge of the food, has now brought Daniel into his favor.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:10</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</blockquote>
<p>We know from verses eleven and sixteen that this Prince was Melzar. He wanted Daniel to know that he was ‘sticking his neck out’ for him and that he could be endangering his position and risking his life.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:11</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</blockquote>
<p>Daniel then suggests in a diplomatic way that his request be tried.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:12</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</blockquote>
<p>Daniel only asked for a ten-day trial. It might be asked if God could not have accomplished all this in one day, and we reply, yes: but if he had, then Melzar would have known that it was not the diet. Daniel knew if he requested a vegetable diet that he would not be eating anything or drinking wine that had been offered to idols.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:13</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</blockquote>
<p>Daniel was willing to let Melzar make the decision on who looked the best in a trial period of ten days.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:14</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</blockquote>
<p>The results would be at the end of ten days, and they were overwhelming.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:15</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</blockquote>
<p>Ten days later Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego looked healthier and better nourished than others. Although all the children of Judea had to share in the captivity it is a well-established fact that he favored these who trusted in God.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:16</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</blockquote>
<p>Melzar put it to the test. I expect that he kept a close tab on the results.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:17</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</blockquote>
<p>The scripture says God gave the four children “knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom,” This is an example where God gives one man, Daniel, special favor above the others. However, this verse says that God gave Daniel a bonus “and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.” So you see, God did something extra for Daniel.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:18</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</blockquote>
<p>The time has arrived and Melzar, who is the Prince of the Eunuchs, brings Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego into the throne room to be debriefed. They are proficient in literature and science and the arts.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:19</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</blockquote>
<p>It has been three years of hard study, now it is time for the review. So Nebuchadnezzar will examine them, not only for their looks, but also for learning. The king was impressed and they were given jobs as attendants before the king.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:20</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</blockquote>
<p>Their knowledge surpassed their teachers. Gibbons who wrote “Decline and fall of the Roman Empire,” had read more books and had a greater knowledge of history than any professor at Oxford.</p>

<h3>Daniel 1:21</h3>
<blockquote class="primary-scripture">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</blockquote>
<p>This verse declares that Daniel lived to see the end of captivity. Cyrus was the ruler of Persia and conquered Babylon.</p>
