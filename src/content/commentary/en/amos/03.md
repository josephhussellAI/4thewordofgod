<p>Israel and Judah are urged to hear the word of the Lord. God tells them that he is not threatening them without a cause. That lions don&rsquo;t roar without a prey. Trumpets don&rsquo;t sound with a cause. That two cannot walk together unless they are in agreement. The prophet tells them that God does not do anything without revealing his intentions beforehand. He tells the prophet to publish in the palaces from Ashdod to Egypt what he had planned to do about their violence. He lets them know that in the day he pays them a visit that they will be lucky to escape with a table leg or a blanket. God says &ldquo;I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel;&hellip;I will smite the winter house and the summer house&hellip;&rdquo; This visit will not be pleasant. Read the exposition for further details.</p><h2>Uncovering the Divine Drama of God's Imminent Visit</h2><h3>Amos 3:1</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</blockquote><p>God is saying that everyone who is connected with the people brought up out of Egypt to listen. God is speaking to both Israel and Judah&mdash;all the people who had came out of Egypt.</p><h3>Amos 3:2</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</blockquote><p>I have taken no other people to be my own people. I have approved of you, loved you, fed, sustained, and defended you; but because you have forsaken me, have become idolatrous and polluted, therefore will I punish you. And the punishment shall be in proportion to the privileges you have enjoyed, and the grace you have abused. (Clark)</p><h3>Amos 3:3</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</blockquote><p>At one time Israel walked with God and he walked with them but now they are alienated from him. They were unholy and God was holy. God can no longer hold communion with them because they are not willing to walk with God.</p><h3>Amos 3:4</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</blockquote><p>This is a rhetorical question&hellip;the answer is implied in the question. The roar of a lion often terrifies the creature so that it freezes in its tracks. In chapter one and verse two we learned that the Lord roars like a lion after its prey.</p><p>Young lions do not roar in their den but when the prey is in their sight they let out a roar that sometimes stops an animal in its tracks.</p><h3>Amos 3:5</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</blockquote><p>A bird cannot be caught in a snare if there is no bait set for him if there is nothing to lure the bird inside the snare and thus trip the trap and leave him snared inside the cage.</p><h3>Amos 3:6</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?</blockquote><p>He is talking about a war trumpet not a trumpet sounded for feasts and holy days. If they persist in the evil in which they were engaged then God will bring evil upon them in the form of some punishment.</p><h3>Amos 3:7</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</blockquote><p>Before the lord brings disaster he warns his people by his servants the Prophets. Let&rsquo;s look at scripture first and then my comments will follow.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Joh 14:29:</strong> &quot;And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it comes to pass, you may believe.</li><li><strong>Joh 13:19:</strong> &quot;From now on I am telling you before <em>it</em> comes to pass, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am <em>He.</em></li></ul><p>God has consistently revealed His plans:</p><ul><li>God told Noah that he would bring the flood. Gen. 6:17</li><li>God told Abraham and Lot, that He would destroy Sodom and Gomorra.</li><li>God told Joseph about the 7 years&rsquo; famine in Egypt. Gen 41:27</li><li>God told Moses about the plagues. Ex. 9:14</li><li>God told Jonah about the destruction of Nineveh. Jonah 1-4</li><li>God told Amos what he would do to Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, Ammon, Moab, Judah, and Israel. Amos 1,2,3.</li><li>God told the Apostles of the impending doom of unrepentant sinners. Matt.25</li><li>God told the Apostles of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. Matt. 24</li><li>God told the Apostle John of the rise of the Beast. Rev. 12</li><li>God told John of the seven vials of wrath to be poured out on the beast. Rev.16</li><li>God told John that he would take the 10 kingdoms from the Great Whore, that 7 hilled city that ruled over the world and reduce her dominion to 108 acres. Rev. 17</li><li>God told John how he would put the Dragon in the bottomless pit for a 1,000 years. Rev. 20</li></ul><h3>Amos 3:8</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</blockquote><p>Moses was not excused, though slow of speech; nor Isaiah, though of polluted lips; nor Jeremiah, because he was a child; but God said:</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Jer 1:7:</strong> But the LORD said to me, &quot;Do not say, &#39;I am a youth,&#39; Because everywhere I send you, you shall go, And all that I command you, you shall speak.</li><li><strong>Eze 2:8:</strong> &quot;Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.&quot;</li><li><strong>Jer 20:9:</strong> But if I say, &quot;I will not remember Him Or speak anymore in His name,&quot; Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am weary of holding <em>it</em> in, And I cannot endure <em>it.</em></li></ul><p>When God like the roar of a lion issued his denunciations of divine wrath it was enough to make the people tremble. Amos has heard the roar of a lion as he took care of the herd and knew first hand how the roar had thrown the animals into a panic. From this picture we can see the fear that would have struck the heart of his hearers.</p><h3>Amos 3:9</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.</blockquote><p>Even though they would announce it in the palaces of Ashdod and in the palaces of Egypt and upon the mountains of Samaria there was such a stockpile of evil and wrong doing of violence and brutality and people taking to the streets in protest for the oppression the prophet says their meetings and efforts to straighten things out will be futile.</p><h3>Amos 3:10</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</blockquote><p>They had stored up violence and condoned robbery even in the palace for so long that it was woven into their fabric. By now it was a way of life so the prophet uses the words &ldquo;for they know not to do right.&rdquo;</p><h3>Amos 3:11</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.</blockquote><p>Now we are beginning to hear the &ldquo;roar of the Lion&rdquo; this is not the voice of the prophet but the word of the Lord GOD.</p><h3>Amos 3:12</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.</blockquote><p>The prophet pictures a shepherd chasing after a lion that has carried off one of his prize animals and recovers only two legs and a piece of ear. From this analogy he tells Israel that they will be dragged from their beds in Samaria and removed from their living couch in Damascus.</p><h3>Amos 3:13</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</blockquote><p>I suppose this refers to the prophet who will testify that this is not the mere word of some shepherd but the word of the Living GOD.</p><h3>Amos 3:14</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</blockquote><p>God is going to pay them a visit and it&rsquo;s not going to be a friendly visit. His reason for the visit is because their sins are stacked up all the way to heaven. His itinerary calls for a visit to the altars of Bethel and he is going to dehorn the altars and then smash them to the ground.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>1Ki 13:1-5:</strong> Now behold, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD... And he cried against the altar... Then he gave a sign... Now it came about when the king heard the saying... The altar also was split apart...</li><li><strong>Hos 10:13-15:</strong> You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice... Therefore, a tumult will arise... Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness...</li></ul><h3>Amos 3:15</h3><blockquote class="primary-scripture">And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.</blockquote><p>The prophet declares that God will have his army tear down their vacation homes and then their main residences and their luxurious houses will all be demolished. When the Assyrians finished with Samaria it was a heap of rubble and an ash pile.</p>
