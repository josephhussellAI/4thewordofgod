  "content": "<p><strong>HEAVEN AT LAST</strong></p>\n<p>\"On the jasper threshold standing,<br>Like a pilgrim safely landing,<br>See the strange, bright scenes expanding,<br>Ah, 'tis Heaven at last!</p>\n<p>\"What a city, what a glory,<br>Far beyond the fairest story,<br>Of the ages, old and hoary,<br>Ah, 'tis Heaven at last!</p>\n<p>Christ Himself the living splendor,<br>Christ, the Sunshine, mild and tender,<br>Praise to the Lamb we render,<br>Ah, 'tis Heaven at last!</p>\n<p>This is not a description of a renovation or remodeling job. The Bible is explicit about the destruction of heaven and earth. John sees the <strong>New Jerusalem</strong> not the one located in the holy land but one descending from heaven. In the vision he sees God dwelling among us with no death, mourning, crying or pain. A special announcement is being given from the throne of God; “I AM MAKING EVERYTHING NEW!” God promises all this to the <strong>OVERCOMER</strong>. The second death is for all unbelieving, vile etc. An angel shows John the Lambs wife–the Holy City Jerusalem. It shined with brilliance like Jasper. It had 12 gates, 12 angels, and inscriptions on the gates of the 12 tribes. The walls had 12 foundations with an inscription of the 12 apostles. The city was 1400 miles square with walls 200 feet high all of which was made of precious stones. God and Christ were there and their brilliance lightened the city. The pearly gates are always open but only the saved can enter. The redeemed will walk on streets of Gold. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>\n\n<h2>Unveiling the Eternal Promise of a New Heaven and Earth</h2>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.</blockquote>\n<p>“Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.” (ISA 65:17)</p>\n<p>“As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the Lord, “so will your name and descendants endure.” (ISA 66:22)</p>\n<p>But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness. (2PE 3:13)</p>\n<p>According to Foy E. Wallace in his commentary he says the evident meaning of the new earth was that the surroundings were prepared and made favorable for the expansion of the kingdom of Christ, made possible by the removal of Judaism... According to F.I Stanley in his commentary he claims that the churches in chapter one are the new heaven and the new earth in chapter 21. How anyone in their wildest imagination could get the new heaven and the new earth to be the church is a mystery that baffles my imagination.</p>\n<p>Read the above verses of scriptures, think soundly for a few days and you will see that this verse has nothing to do with the beginning of the church on Pentecost as alleged by the <strong>new thinkers</strong>. Now lets get down to business. What we see transpiring here is happening after the First Resurrection, after the millennium, after the general Resurrection, after the wedding supper of the lamb. This old earth will be so polluted by mankind that it will be necessary for God to make a new one.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.</blockquote>\n<p>In ver 10 John describes the great city the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. Remember when Jesus was with us he said, “In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.” (John 14:2)</p>\n<p>This heavenly city is the place that Jesus has prepared for us. It has a golden street, gates of pearls, walls of jasper etc. I believe the people of heaven will be immortal and that We shall see God and Christ and the Holy spirit, and angels and saints past and present. These fellows with a <strong>figurative city</strong> that they call the church will not have any place to go when this life is over. If this city isn't real is anything else in this book real? Hurry and get ready! Join the throng that will be singing the song of Moses and the Lamb!</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.</blockquote>\n<p>This hasn't happened yet brethren. Since the resurrection hasn't occurred this couldn't have possibly occurred as alleged by the new wing thinkers.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Now the new wing thinkers really have a problem, since they maintain this chapter was fulfilled at Pentecost. But the fact remains that John says there will be no more death. There was death when John wrote and we still have death. What this verse teaches is that there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. If Stanley and Wallace are correct then we had better get a new hymn book.</p>\n<p>The author of this commentary is not ashamed to admit that he believes in the \"Old Time Religion\".</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He who was seated on the throne said, \"I am making everything new!\" Then he said, \"Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>I got the message!</i> Did you? Everything new!! God is trustworthy and his word is true.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He said to me: \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.</blockquote>\n<p>It’s hard to wait for something as wonderful as the promises that are in this chapter, but God says, “I will give to drink without cost.” You will not need to check your pocket for money because it’s free!</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Overcomes</strong> is a favorite word of Jesus. When you feel crushed, defeated and downcast Jesus calls upon you to surmount, and subdue, and conquer, and overthrow your enemy. Dear reader if your soul has wandered into sin you may overcome the fetters that hold you. What John says is that if we overcome we will inherit all this that is the new heaven and the new earth.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars–their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\"</blockquote>\n<p>There is always those who are afraid to do right or resist wrong. These people are surely not in heaven. They end up where they belong–in the lake of fire.</p>\n<p>It is clear from their books that they no longer believe that the wicked will suffer a <strong>second death</strong> in the lake of fire. They say it is all figurative and has already happened. Shades of heresy! This slick doctrine had permeated our churches. You will not need to adjust your bifocals to see that the second death has not yet occurred but will take place when the Lord comes and sits on his great white throne.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:9-10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, \"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\" And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.</blockquote>\n<p>Read on friends and you will see that the bride is not the church as claimed by the new right-wingers. It is a city where the redeemed of God will eventually dwell. Remember that John saw all this after the resurrection of the dead!</p>\n<p>Was this the church that John saw coming down at Pentecost? F. I. Stanley says, “We conclude, therefore, when John saw the new heaven and earth, the new Jerusalem, he saw the church and those who dwell therein.” Now this just doesn't fit with the rest of the chapter. Where are the high walls in the church? Where are the twelve gates? Where is the golden street?</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:11-12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.</blockquote>\n<p>Jasper is a precious stone–quartz like, variegated with divers colors, some sea green and dazzling in brilliance. I get excited just thinking about a city with such splendor. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. This shows that Israel was recognized among the saved.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>East:</strong> Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.</li>\n<li><strong>North:</strong> Dan, Ashar and Naphtali.</li>\n<li><strong>South:</strong> Reuben, Simeon and Gad.</li>\n<li><strong>West:</strong> Ephraim, Manasseh and Benjamin.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:14</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</blockquote>\n<p>John would have found the following names on the walls of the city: Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon Zelotes, and Matthias.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:15-17</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city... The city was laid out like a square... He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length... He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits thick...</blockquote>\n<p>The survey crew reported the measurements. As we calculate it the measurement would be three hundred and fifty miles on each side giving us fourteen hundred square miles. Here we have a picture of the city in which the redeemed will occupy having walls and gates that excel anything that mankind could imagine. The ancient city of Jerusalem was patterned after the heavenly city.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:18-20</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone.</blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt>First Jasper</dt>\n<dd>Milky white and clear (diamond).</dd>\n<dt>Second Sapphire</dt>\n<dd>Bright blue.</dd>\n<dt>Third Chalcedony</dt>\n<dd>Milky peach color.</dd>\n<dt>Fourth Emerald</dt>\n<dd>Rich green.</dd>\n<dt>Fifth Sardonyx</dt>\n<dd>Flesh color, kind of onyx used in cameos.</dd>\n<dt>The Sixth Carnelian</dt>\n<dd>Blood red, Sardis stone in K.G.</dd>\n<dt>The Seventh Chrysolite</dt>\n<dd>Pale sea green.</dd>\n<dt>Eighth Beryl</dt>\n<dd>Blue green.</dd>\n<dt>Ninth Topaz</dt>\n<dd>Bottle green.</dd>\n<dt>Tenth Chrysoprase</dt>\n<dd>Apple green.</dd>\n<dt>Eleventh Jacinth</dt>\n<dd>Light red with sparkle.</dd>\n<dt>Twelfth Amethyst</dt>\n<dd>Violet purple.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:21</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.</blockquote>\n<p>Only God could make a pearl this size. Fort Knox doesn't have enough gold to pave these streets. King David donated 110 tons of Gold for the building of the temple, but that would not begin to pave the streets of the eternal city.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:22-26</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple... The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it... On no day will its gates ever be shut...</blockquote>\n<p>The ancient city of Jerusalem had Solomon's temple in it. Here, the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. There will be no need of street lights there. We will not need to lock the doors at night for there will be no criminals there.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 21:27</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.</blockquote>\n<p>You will not need to adjust your bifocals to see that the second death has not yet occurred but will take place when the Lord comes. The dead will be judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.</p>",
