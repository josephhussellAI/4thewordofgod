  "content": "<p>When Daniel finished the Book Of Daniel he was told to \"shut up the words, and seal the book\" (Dan 12:4). John was instructed just the opposite: \"Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand\" (Rev. 22:10). Contrary to the speculations regarding another date it seems certain that John wrote the book about A.D. 96.</p><p>We are first introduced to symbolism. It was a \"spiritual code\"; only bible readers could understand this code. No officer (Government official) could cite any of this document against believers. However, do not get trapped into believing that the events described under symbols are not real. About 300 references to the Old Testament are found in this one book. If we anchor our ideas based on what the Old Testament teaches then we will have a true interpretation. If you are not grounded in the interpretation of Old Testament prophecies then you will not understand the code. In most cases I will refer you back to the Old Testament so you will see how the code was applied.</p><h2>Unveiling the Divine Mysteries of the Eternal Alpha and Omega</h2><h3>Revelation 1:1-3</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who testifies to everything he saw–that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.</blockquote><p><strong>The revelation of Jesus Christ:</strong> Jesus Christ is the fountain of truth and knowledge. John is merely acting in the capacity of a scribe or secretary. He is about to give us a revelation that is unmatched in excitement and glorious to behold. Revelation means the unveiling of divine mysteries—to uncover. Jesus said \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed\" (Mt. 10:26).</p><p>Revelation is a twisted rope rather than a tangled web. If we untwist the threads and lay them side by side, we shall not have much difficulty if we exercise all that reverent and painstaking care which is due to the examination of every part of the word of God. Therefore, we can conclude that <strong>IT IS A REVELATION–NOT A MYSTERY</strong>.</p><p>An angel is the instrument and John is the recipient. He made it known by signs and symbols (cf. Hieroglyphics). <strong>\"Blessed is the one who reads...\"</strong> In ancient times one stood up and read publicly before the assembly. Few believers could look forward to owning a bible, therefore the function of a reader was tremendously important. The blessings result from the fact that the truth exerts an influence over our lives.</p><h3>Revelation 1:4-5a</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits [Or the sevenfold Spirit] before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.</blockquote><p>Asia did not mean in the first century what it does today. It was a Roman province of which Ephesus was the capital. <strong>Grace and peace:</strong> The word grace occurs 129 times in the K.J. translation. Thayer gives this primary definition: \"Sweetness, charm, loveliness\" and explains it to signify \"that which affords joy, pleasure, delight.\" Other definitions include good-will, loving kindness, and favor. The word peace was a favorite benediction of Jesus (Luke 10:5, John 14:27).</p><p><strong>\"And from the seven spirits...\"</strong> Seven denotes the full complete or manifold working of the Holy Spirit on the Souls of men and the affairs of the world. <strong>\"The faithful witness...\"</strong> He is one in whom we can put complete reliance. He was the first to be raised from the dead never to die again.</p><h3>Revelation 1:5b-8</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen. Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen. \"I am the Alpha and the Omega,\" says the Lord God, \"who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.\"</blockquote><p><strong>Alpha and Omega:</strong> Doctors take X-rays to reveal our bones and sonograms to see tissue, but the Alpha and Omega can see the heart of man. Jesus Christ will thoroughly examine and completely diagnose his churches and where necessary prescribe a remedy. He was our Alpha and Omega before the world was and shall be when the new world is. This indicated his exalted nature and supreme authority.</p><p><strong>\"Amen\"</strong> occurs 150 times in the N.T. Greek. Thayer says that at the beginning of a discourse it means \"surely, of a truth, truly.\" When used at the close of a sentence it means, \"so be it, may it be fulfilled.\"</p><h3>Revelation 1:9-11</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit...</blockquote><p>Irenaeus (2nd Century) says John was banished by Domitian, Emperor of Rome, about A.D. 95 or 96. <strong>PATMOS:</strong> This island is about 6 to 8 miles in length and about 15 miles in circumference. Anciently it was a convict quarry. Sir William Ramsey describes it as a terrible fate marked by perpetual fetters, scanty clothing, and work under the lash.</p><p><strong>On the Lord's Day:</strong> The day which commemorates our Lord's conquering. Justin Martyr (150 A.D.) confirms that Christians met on the day called Sunday to read Scriptures. <strong>In the Spirit:</strong> John had passed into a state of prophetic illumination.</p><h3>Revelation 1:12-16</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and among the lampstands was someone \"like a son of man,\" dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest...</blockquote><p><strong>Seven golden lampstands:</strong> A lampstand has no light of itself but is dependent upon the oil and wick. Likewise, N.T. churches have no light of themselves; they are dependent on the \"Light of the Gospel.\" Christ is walking among them trimming the wicks and supplying the oil.</p><dl><dt><strong>Robe and Golden Sash</strong></dt><dd>Denoting royalty and the High Priesthood (Exodus 28:8). Jesus is our high priest under the order of Melchizedek.</dd><dt><strong>Head and Hair White like Wool</strong></dt><dd>Suggesting purity and the Ancient of Days. Knowledge, wisdom, and experience.</dd><dt><strong>Eyes like Blazing Fire</strong></dt><dd>He sees all before his penetrating eyes (Heb 4:13). The Lord Jesus can look into your past, your present, and your future.</dd><dt><strong>Feet like Bronze</strong></dt><dd>He bore our judgment on the cross—refined, pure, and clean.</dd><dt><strong>Voice like Rushing Waters</strong></dt><dd>Like the roar of a mighty cataract, he sounded forth power and judgment.</dd><dt><strong>Sharp Double-edged Sword</strong></dt><dd>The word of Christ is penetrating. It awakens the conscience, lays bare secret feelings, and slays the old man of sin.</dd></dl><h3>Revelation 1:17-18</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">\"When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: \"Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last... And I hold the keys of death and Hades.</blockquote><p>Jesus laid his right hand upon John and reassured him He wanted John to know who he was and that He was <strong>GOD</strong>. He holds the keys of the visible and invisible world, therefore he can accomplish all his plans and execute all his designs.</p><h3>Revelation 1:19-20</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">“Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later. The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels [Or messengers] of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</blockquote><p>John is instructed to write the <strong>PAST</strong>, The <strong>PRESENT</strong> (Condition of the seven churches), and the <strong>FUTURE</strong> (World history in prophecy). Why write if no one can understand it?</p><p><strong>The seven stars:</strong> These are the angels or messengers of the seven churches. This concept is borrowed from the Jewish synagogue, where the messenger of the assembly presided. It would be absurd to command John to write to an actual angel in heaven. Much like Joseph's dream in Genesis 37 where stars represented his brothers (future tribes), these stars refer to the Bishops or leaders of the seven churches.</p>",
