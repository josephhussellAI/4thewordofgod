  "title": "The Seven Churches: Letters to Ephesus and Ancient Cities",
  "content": "<p>The temple of Diana was located here. It was one of the seven wonders of the world. Paul spent three years here. Timothy labored here. Aquila, Priscilla, Apollos, Gius, and Aristarchus are all of Ephesus. It was a rich, magnificent, commercial city with large harbors. There is not now a single house upon the sight of this ancient city. Near is a small Turkish village of Ayasaluk.</p><p>They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews (Acts 18:19). While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples (Acts 19:1).</p><p>In Acts 19:29 a theater is mentioned. This theater was capable of holding 25,000 to 30,000 and was the largest ever built by the Greeks. It was 685 feet long and 200 feet wide. All these churches are nonexistent but the word of God liveth and abideth forever.</p><h2>Returning to First Love and Avoiding Spiritual Judgment</h2><h3>Revelation 2:1</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:</blockquote><p>The bishop of this church is told that Jesus has an omniscient eye to determine the state of his church. Jesus says He holds the seven stars in his right hand, thus showing that they are dependent on him. He said in John 15:5 <em>&quot;For without me ye can do nothing.&quot;</em> Jesus is walking in the midst of his churches; this denoted the constant supervision, inspection, and surveillance.</p><p>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account (Heb 4:13). But the Lord said to Samuel, &quot;Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart&quot; (I Sam. 16:7).</p><h3>Revelation 2:2</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance.</blockquote><p>Jesus said he knew their works. They had not been idle or listless but active, alert, and energetic in his service. Labor refers to toiling in faithful service especially in opposing error.</p><p>We cannot tolerate wicked men and those who claim to be apostles. They had thoroughly examined their claims and found their pretensions unfounded and false. They are praised for their intolerance.</p><h3>Revelation 2:3</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.</blockquote><p>Persevering—enduring hardships—not becoming weary.</p><h3>Revelation 2:4</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love. Remember when you first fell in love?</blockquote><p>Observers said, &quot;He will get over it!&quot; That is exactly what occurred with God's children in this church. They got over it! That is, they ceased loving Christ first! God, save us from getting over it! Many today have shifted their love for Christ to love for doctrine. This is <strong>legalism</strong>—right thing but wrong motive.</p><p>This church had left their real love and devotion to Christ. Can a husband see his wife grow cold and not be grieved? They had become defenders of the faith, arming themselves with the heroic virtues of truth and courage, only to discover that in the battle they had lost the one quality without which all others are worthless.</p><h3>Revelation 2:5</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.</blockquote><p>This group of cold-hearted professors were in a state of spiritual declension. They had fallen from a height of excellence. Now they needed to reflect upon their fall and come to repentance. <em>I will come to you and remove your lampstand.</em> Not in person but in judgment. If there is any doubt that the lampstand has been removed just visit Ephesus. The city now lies in ruins.</p><h3>Revelation 2:6</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</blockquote><p>Deeds of the <strong>Nicolaitans</strong>: little is known about this sect.</p><h3>Revelation 2:7</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</blockquote><p><strong>Tree of life</strong>. Man is separated from it lest he eat of it and live forever in sin. After he overcomes he may eat it and live forever in the paradise of God. It is mentioned three times in Genesis and three times in Revelation.</p><p>Here <strong>Polycarp</strong> was burned at the stake in 168 A.D. when he was 86 years old. He was converted in A.D. 82. Ignatos tells us that he was Bishop at Smyrna in 108 A.D. Tertullian tells us that he was ordained by John. Polycarp was urged to say &quot;Caesar is Lord&quot; but refused. He was brought to the stadium and the proconsul urged him saying &quot;swear and I will set you at liberty, reproach Christ.&quot; Polycarp answered, &quot;86 years I have served him and he never did me any injury, how then can I blaspheme my Lord and Saviour.&quot; This church which was located 40 miles North West of Ephesus has been called the persecuted Church.</p><h2>Enduring Tribulation for the Crown of Life</h2><h3>Revelation 2:8</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.</blockquote><p>Jesus identifies himself as the God of the Old Testament. Jesus Christ is:</p><dl><dt>OMNIPOTENT</dt><dd>All powerful.</dd><dt>OMNIFIC</dt><dd>All creating.</dd><dt>OMNIPRESENT</dt><dd>Present everywhere at once.</dd><dt>OMNISCIENT</dt><dd>Possessing infinite knowledge.</dd></dl><p>Jesus tells this church that he has been through it all. <em>Who died and came to life again.</em> He wants them to know that he understands what they are experiencing. He informs them that he is a discerner of values. Jesus values his church according to what they are as well as what they do.</p><h3>Revelation 2:9</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I know your afflictions and your poverty–yet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</blockquote><p>Jesus knows our works. It is crystal clear from the Scriptures that we are not saved by works but rather by grace. James 2:21 tells us that Abraham was justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar. Remember Abraham was called at the age of 75. His son was born when he was 100 and was offered when he was about 17 years old. Romans chapter 4 tells us that Abraham was justified by faith when he was 100 years old–thus the Bible says that Abraham was called at age 75, Justified by faith at age 100, and Justified by works at age 117.</p><p><em>Yet you are rich!</em> They were rich in faith, hope, and works. Jesus pleaded their poverty. You will not need to plead your poverty.</p><p><em>I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not.</em> Jesus knows the <strong>Blasphemy</strong> of them who say they are Jews. The word Blasphemy means vilification against God; any evil speaking or railing against our maker. <em>But are a synagogue of Satan.</em> The Devil is the real agent. These Jews were his instruments.</p><h3>Revelation 2:10</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.</blockquote><p>Cast into prison, tried... tribulation ten days... faithful unto death. I will list the ten primitive persecutions beginning with Nero to Diocletian:</p><ol><li>Under Nero, A.D. 67</li><li>Under Domitian, A.D. 81</li><li>Under Trajan, A.D. 108</li><li>Under Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, A.D. 162</li><li>Under Severus, A.D. 192</li><li>Under Maximus, A.D. 235</li><li>Under Decius A.D. 249</li><li>Under Valerian, A.D. 257</li><li>Under Aurelian, A.D. 274</li><li>Under Diocletian, A.D. 303</li></ol><p>During the reign of Diocletian an edict was issued to exterminate Christianity from the earth. The fatal day was fixed for Feb. 23rd, A.D. 303. This persecution lasted for ten years. Is it any wonder that Jesus exhorted his followers to be faithful unto death?</p><h3>Revelation 2:11</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death.</blockquote><p>There are two births and two deaths in the Bible. We can avoid the second death by a second birth (John 3:3-5).</p><p>The following message is being sent to the Bishop of the church at Pergamos. It was a large city and capital of a province of Asia Minor. It had a large library of 200,000 volumes; also a famed temple of <strong>Asclepius</strong>, the God of healing who was worshipped under the emblem of a serpent which believers in Christ believed to be the very symbol of Satan. This is still a medical symbol today.</p><h2>Upholding Truth in the Dwelling Place of Satan</h2><h3>Revelation 2:12</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.</blockquote><p>Jesus identifies himself to this church as the one with a two-edged sword. The word of Christ is as penetrating as a sword with two edges (Heb. 4:12). The sword of God's word is seen in awakening the conscience; alarming the fears; laying bare the secret feelings of the heart, and causing the sinner to tremble with the apprehension of the coming judgment. It slays the old man of sin. They may have a library of 200,000 volumes but only the word of Christ can save them.</p><h3>Revelation 2:13</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I know where you live–where Satan has his throne. You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city–where Satan lives.</blockquote><p><em>Where Satan’s seat is.</em> It was a pantheon of heathen deities and pagan rites, the great altar of Zeus, Minerva, Apollo, Venus, Bacchus, and Aesculapius were here. The word Pergamos meant &quot;the place of Nuptials.&quot; No doubt it refers to the worship of Asclepius whose symbol was a serpent. His priests performed charms and incantations, crowds resorted to his temple where lying miracles were alleged to be performed; in his honor, a living serpent was kept and fed in the temple. Serpent worship was the marked character.</p><p>Tradition says that <strong>Antipas</strong> was the first Christian to be martyr slain by the Romans. That he was shut up inside a brazen bull to end his life by starvation. He ended his life in thanksgiving and prayer.</p><h3>Revelation 2:14</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.</blockquote><p>Balaam first seduced Israel to the worship of Baal and then tempted them into lewdness and fornication. The Greek term <strong>Nicolaitan</strong> is equivalent to <strong>Balaam</strong> in Hebrew. Both mean &quot;destroyer of people&quot;. Commentaries generally agree that they held to a community of wives, regarded adultery and fornication as matters of indifference and permitted the eating of things sacrificed to Idols.</p><h3>Revelation 2:15</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</blockquote><p>The church suffers when it permits wicked men in its bosom.</p><h3>Revelation 2:16</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</blockquote><p>Repent. If they would not repent then he would direct heavy judgment against them.</p><h3>Revelation 2:17</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it.</blockquote><p><strong>Hidden manna</strong> and a <strong>white stone</strong>. The grace of Christ and all its glorious fruits will be their food. A white stone was a symbol of acquittal and a black stone of guilt. A white stone was put into a vessel by a jury to vote acquittal for a person on trial. Jesus, would therefore vote on acquittal for them if they overcome.</p><p>This church was located in a city known for its trade guilds. Thyatira was famous for its purple dye and cloth. A very famous Christian known to us–Lydia–lived here. The first of the seven churches was seen as weakening its love yet it was faithful to judge false teachers, while the church at Thyatira was growing in love, and tolerant of false teachers. Both extremes must be avoided.</p><h2>Resisting Seduction and Holding Fast Until Christ Comes</h2><h3>Revelation 2:18</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.</blockquote><p>Thyatira–Center of communication–a trading city. Here we find the <strong>trade guilds</strong>: wool workers, linen workers, makers of outer garments, dyers, etc. These trade guilds were associated with the worship of tutelary Gods. Each guild had its guardian gods. The scenario would be somewhat as follows:</p><ol><li>Membership to guild implies that you worship its god.</li><li>You would be expected to attend its festivals and eat what was offered to the tutelary god.</li><li>When the feast ends—and the fun begins (grossly immoral)—if you walk out you would be ridiculed and persecuted.</li><li>What must a Christian do? (a) If he quits the union, he loses his position and standing in society—he might even go hungry. (b) If he remains and attends the feasts—eating and drinking things offered to Idols and committing fornication, he denies the Lord.</li></ol><p><strong>Jezebel</strong> had the answer. She apparently argued: in order to conquer Satan you must know him. Hence, by all means, attend the guild feasts and commit fornication—and still remain a Christian.</p><h3>Revelation 2:19</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.</blockquote><p>Those works that had most recently been performed were more numerous and more commendable than those which had been rendered formerly. Religion in the soul is designed to be progressive. Are your last works better than your former?</p><h3>Revelation 2:20</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.</blockquote><p><strong>JEZEBEL</strong>. Daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre. A woman of vast influence which was uniformly exerted for evil. The kind of woman therefore designated would be one who was a thorough advocate of evil; unscrupulous and whose influence lead people into abominable practices of idolatry.</p><h3>Revelation 2:21-22</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling. So I will cast her on a bed of suffering...</blockquote><p>I will cast her into a bed. Not a bed of ease but a bed of pain, diseases of body and tortures of soul.</p><h3>Revelation 2:23</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.</blockquote><p>I search reigns and hearts. Jesus searches the innermost mind and the secrets of the soul.</p><h3>Revelation 2:24-25</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira... Only hold on to what you have until I come.</blockquote><p>Hold fast till I come. This is a sermon in a nutshell. Jesus wants us to be on guard. To stand firm in the faith.</p><h3>Revelation 2:26-28</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations... I will also give him the morning star.</blockquote><p>To rule with a scepter of iron is not to rule with a harsh and tyrannical sway, but with power that is firm and invincible. This does not mean that the church will rule the world by temporal power, but that it will yield a sway that is a great spiritual power and influence over all nations.</p><h3>Revelation 2:29</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</blockquote><p>Dear reader, it behooves us to listen to the word of God.</p>",
