  "content": "<p>In our discussion of the seven seals we disclosed the fall of the Roman Empire. The seventh seal is developed by seven trumpets, and when the last is sounded this announcement is made: &quot;The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of His Christ: and He shall reign for ever and ever&quot; (Rev. 11:15). Now the real question is what the kingdom of the world became. Did the kingdom of the world go to the Devil or become the kingdom of the Lord? Is this world headed for a better day or headed for the rocks? Did Jesus send us out with a message of despair or a message of hope? Either the gospel is good news or bad news. Either Christ and His kingdom shall triumph or the kingdom of Satan. In this chapter we will find the answer to these questions.</p><p>We know that &quot;the gospel is the power of God&quot; (Rom 1:16) and that it is the means of Satan's downfall (Rom. 16:20). Jesus shall reign until every enemy is abolished (I Cor. 15:25,26). Yes Christian friend there is hope for a brighter day and this chapter forecasts such a triumph.</p><p>Alleluia! We have heretofore described the proclamation of &quot;eternal good tidings&quot; (Rev. 14:6,7). This proclamation of the Gospel has been committed to the church. Therefore, the idea of an angel &quot;flying through the midst of heaven proclaiming the word to every nation and tribe and tongue and people&quot; must have reference to an effort to evangelize the world by means of satellite communications used by the people of God to proclaim the gospel.</p><p>In the previous chapter (19:11-16) we have the following description: A rider on a white horse, followed by warriors &quot;clothed in fine linen, white and pure,&quot; a sword is protruding from the mouth of the rider on the horse. This sword is the word by which he will smite the Nations and take rule of the world resulting in the fall of <strong>Mystery, Babylon the Great</strong> (17:5). We have already described the power and the Roman Catholic church. The False Prophet, of which we have described as Mohammed, along with these powers and the Kings of the Earth are described as being overthrown. The nations of this earth are doomed because of their misrule, because they supported these beastly institutions. Evidence of that fact at present is the diplomatic relation between the Vatican and all civilized nations.</p><p>The Devil is arrested and incarcerated. He is sentenced without parole for a thousand years. Our Lord spoke of Satan's defeat as a result of preaching by the seventy (Luke 10:17,18). In Rev. 12:10-11, Satan (who is called the dragon with seven heads and ten horns) is overcome by three means:</p><ul><li>The blood of Christ</li><li>The testimony of the gospel</li><li>The suffering of the church</li></ul><p>Martyrs are reigning with Christ for a thousand years. This is called the <strong>first resurrection</strong>. After the millennium Satan will be released for a short period. Like most released convicts he is incorrigible and goes out to stir up more trouble but this time God will put him and the false prophet where they belong—in the lake of fire and brimstone to be tormented for ever and ever. In the previous chapter we noted that the beast and the false prophet were already in the lake of fire and brimstone. The general resurrection will then occur in which all the dead will participate. The whole world will be judged and those written in the <strong>Book of Life</strong> will experience all that is promised them in the next two chapters. You are now invited to join me in an analysis of the text.</p><h2>Unveiling the Millennium and the Final Judgment of Souls</h2><h3>Revelation 20:1</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.</blockquote><p>Prisoners were generally taken to dungeons where there were bars and little or no light. In this verse we are told of a pit in which the Devil is thrown and the door is closed behind and locked. He is chained to the walls of this prison and will be there for a long, long time.</p><h3>Revelation 20:2</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.</blockquote><p>Yes, they caught the dragon (Paganism). He is identified by many titles:</p><ul><li>Alias the Devil</li><li>Alias Satan</li><li>Alias the Seducer</li><li>Alias the Father of Lies</li><li>Alias the Evil One</li><li>Alias the Angel of the Bottomless Pit</li><li>Alias God of this World</li><li>Alias Prince of the Power of The Air</li><li>Alias Apollyon</li><li>Alias Abadon</li><li>Alias Beliel</li><li>Alias Beelzebub</li></ul><h3>Revelation 20:3</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.</blockquote><p>The seal would prevent intrusion by secretly opening the door. It will be a long, long time before the parole board meets.</p><h3>Revelation 20:4</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</blockquote><p>This is the <strong>reign of the martyrs</strong>. In 6:9-11 these martyrs are seen &quot;underneath the altar,&quot; crying for judgment on those who had slain them. They are told to &quot;rest yet for a little time&quot; until more have been killed. In 13:15 power is given the Beast to kill those who would not worship his image. In 17:6 Babylon, the papal church, is described as being &quot;drunken with the blood of the saints.&quot; Since the same martyr class is spoken of in the twentieth chapter as reigning with Christ, it follows that the millennium is the reign of martyrs.</p><p>Many speak of the millennium as if they were going to participate in it when they haven’t suffered a briar scratch for Jesus. Our generation has had clashing, discord, strife, wrangling, contentions, but few can lay claim to martyrdom. Consider the history of suffering:</p><ul><li><strong>Stephen</strong> suffered martyrdom at Jerusalem.</li><li><strong>James the son of Zebedee</strong> was martyred by Herod Agrippa.</li><li><strong>Phillip</strong> suffered martyrdom at Heliopolis, in Phrygia; scourged, imprisoned, and crucified.</li><li><strong>Matthew</strong> suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia, slain with a halberd.</li><li><strong>James the Less</strong> was beaten, stoned, and had his brains dashed out.</li><li><strong>Matthias</strong> was stoned at Jerusalem and beheaded.</li><li><strong>Andrew</strong> was taken and crucified on a cross at Edessa.</li><li><strong>Mark</strong> was dragged to pieces by the people of Alexandria.</li><li><strong>Peter</strong> was crucified at Rome.</li><li><strong>Paul</strong> was crucified at Rome under Nero.</li><li><strong>Jude</strong> was crucified at Edessa.</li><li><strong>Bartholomew</strong> was crucified in India.</li><li><strong>Thomas</strong> was martyred by Pagan priests in India.</li><li><strong>Luke</strong> was hanged on an olive tree by idolatrous priests in Greece.</li><li><strong>Simon</strong> was crucified in Britain.</li></ul><p>The list is endless; historians estimate that at least fifty million were killed by Papal Rome during the dark ages. But, the church daily increased, deeply rooted in the doctrine of the apostles and watered with the blood of saints. Beloved how does it appear to you? Does it not say in this verse of scripture that these martyred ones are going to reign with Christ a thousand years? I am not interested in speculative theories but rather in the truth of Gods word.</p><h3>Revelation 20:5</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.</blockquote><p>According to sound hermeneutics the meaning of any passage is to be obtained from its context and to harmonize with it. According to the text only those who risked their lives and were killed for their faith shall share in this blessed millennium. The highest degree of honor is reserved for those who drink his cup of suffering. Respected reader, how does it appear to you?</p><h3>Revelation 20:6</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.</blockquote><p>There is an absurd doctrine being taught and widely accepted that this has reference to baptism. Such a doctrine is so ludicrous and incredible that one wonders how intelligent reasoning students of the scripture could think so irrational.</p><h3>Revelation 20:7</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison</blockquote><p>The parole board meets and releases Satan and he goes on another of his sinful rampages. He evidently promised God that he would be good if he would release him.</p><h3>Revelation 20:8</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth–Gog and Magog–to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.</blockquote><p>The term <strong>four corners of the earth</strong> mean four directions North, South, East and West. In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant that is left of his people (ISA 11:11,12). The terms <strong>Gog and Magog</strong> are found in the Old Testament. In Ezekiel 38 we have a Scythian attack upon Israel which was made by Gog and Magog; this included Persia in the East, Cush in the South, Put in the West, and Gog and Magog, Rosh Mesh, and Tubal in the North. This four corner attack was a massive attack upon Israel. Now John is prophesying of a similar attack from the same regions (namely a four corner attack) against his beloved city.</p><h3>Revelation 20:9</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.</blockquote><p>This must have reference to Jerusalem (Psalms 132:13). Brothers, this is the last war and Satan will lose the battle because God himself will intervene with fire from Heaven and destroy the enemies. Satan will be tried for war crimes and thrown into the lake of fire. God has been known in the past to destroy his enemies with fire, as seen in Genesis 19:24, 1 Kings 18:38, and 2 Kings 1:10-14.</p><h3>Revelation 20:10</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</blockquote><p>Well finally the Devil ends up where he belongs. If the <strong>lake of fire</strong> is only figurative, then it must be more awful, for the fact must of necessity be stronger than the figure. If this is, as some affirm, figurative, then the devil is figurative, and so also is God. Children of God, be careful not to be entrapped with such sophistry.</p><h3>Revelation 20:11</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.</blockquote><p>When Luke wrote to Theophilus, he tells us that his coming would be like his departure (Acts 1:9, 11). When he comes again it shall be with clouds and every eye shall see him (Rev 1:7). His departure was with Angels and his coming will be with angels (Mat 25:31). Jesus will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God to wake the dead from their sleep (1 Thess 4:16). Simultaneous with the raising of all the dead saints the living saints will be changed from mortality to immortality (1 Thess 4:15-17).</p><h3>Revelation 20:12</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.</blockquote><p>OH! My soul: You and I must be there. Our history known and our conscience laid bare. Jesus said we would be judged by His words (John 12:48). This fact is further established and collaborated by the scriptures (John 6:39, 40; John 11:24).</p><h3>Revelation 20:13</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done.</blockquote><p>According to Paul, God will judge the world (Acts 17:31). Jesus taught that all nations would be present for this judgment (Mat 25:31-46), separating the sheep from the goats.</p><h3>Revelation 20:14</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.</blockquote><p>Jesus Christ will deliver His kingdom to God at this time according to I Corinthians 15:24-28, having destroyed all dominion, authority, and power.</p><h3>Revelation 20:15</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</blockquote><p>The word of the Lord teaches that the present material universe will be destroyed by fire and a new universe created (Ps. 102:25,26). This event is connected with the Lord's coming. As Peter wrote, &quot;The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire&quot; (2 Pet. 3:8-13). Accordingly, John &quot;saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away: and the sea is no more&quot; (Rev. 21:1). Furthermore, John saw the &quot;new Jerusalem,&quot; defined and explained as the &quot;wife of the Lamb&quot; coming down from heaven to the new earth as the saints' eternal home.</p>",
