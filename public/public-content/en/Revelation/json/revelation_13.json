  "content": "<p>In chapter 11, John gave us an account of the witnesses of Jesus, the Word of God, from the time it was all completed and brought into one volume, to the time it was restored to the Lord's people after lying dead (in dead languages) for 1260 years. In chapter 12, he gave us an account of the church in the wilderness (during the time the Bible was not used as a measure) for 1260 years. Now, he gives us a perfect view of the power that put down the Word of God and drove the church into the wilderness. He speaks of the power that was to wear out the saints, war against the Word of God, blaspheme the God of heaven, the tabernacle (church) and them that dwell therein, and compel the world to worship him.</p>\n\n<p>The word <strong>&quot;sea&quot;</strong> is a symbol of the religious or Christian world. He sees a beast rise up out of the sea. This beast comes up out of the religious part of humanity. This beast is a kingdom. We know this for certain because the seventh chapter of Daniel says it was. This beast has the same number of heads and horns as the red dragon that made war on the woman, chapter 12. But the red dragon gave his seat (<strong>ROME</strong>) and power (<strong>OF THE SWORD</strong>) and great authority (<strong>OF THE CAESARS</strong>) to the beast that came up out of the religious world. This second beast is spotted. It is both political and religious. He has the three-fold appearance of the leopard, bear and lion. He is characterized by strength, thirst for blood, destructiveness.</p>\n\n<p>This beast is the last part of the Roman Empire that drew the third part of the stars of heaven (illustrious men of the church) and cast them down to the earth (worldliness) again. It is the Papal power that grew up out of the Pagan form of Roman Government. Proof of this is: the dragon gave him his seat, power and authority.</p>\n\n<p>Now let us sum it up:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The two witnesses lay dead (in dead languages) 1260 years.</li>\n  <li>The woman was in the wilderness 1260 years.</li>\n  <li>The measuring rod was not used for 1260 years.</li>\n  <li>This beast had power to blaspheme and persecute for 1260 years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The very constitution of the Catholic Church proves its Pagan origin and nature. Most of the doctrines and practices of present day Catholics are little more than a revamping of ancient heathenism.</p>\n\n<p>The beast exists now. Many honest Christians who are now involved with it will soon learn the facts about it. God says &quot;come out of her my people&quot;. It has characteristics of the four beasts (nations) which existed before it. Let's take a look at them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>&quot;The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.&quot; (Rev. 13:2)</blockquote>\n\n<p>What nations are these? The Bible tells us who they are.</p>\n\n<blockquote>&quot;The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.&quot; (Daniel 7:17)</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are the four world empires, ruling consecutively from the time of Daniel down to the time of the fall of Rome:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Babylon</strong> (605 - 538 B.C.)</li>\n  <li><strong>Medo Persia</strong> (538 - 331 B.C.)</li>\n  <li><strong>Greece</strong> (331 - 168 B.C.)</li>\n  <li><strong>Rome</strong> (168 - 476 A.D.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For a more complete picture Daniel said:</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea...&quot; (Daniel 7:2-8)</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow! What a picture:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt>THE LION</dt>\n  <dd><strong>BABYLON</strong>. Represented by the two-winged lion. Today, in the ruins of ancient Babylon can still be seen broken statues of lions with two wings. The two wings tell us of the swiftness in which the &quot;golden kingdom&quot; conquered the civilized world.</dd>\n  <dt>THE BEAR</dt>\n  <dd><strong>MEDO PERSIA</strong>. Conquered Babylon in 538 B.C. It was a rule with the Medo Persians that once they made a law – it stuck. In a parallel way, the Popes of Rome claim infallibility.</dd>\n  <dt>THE LEOPARD</dt>\n  <dd><strong>GREECE</strong>. Alexander the Great conquered the world in only 13 years (represented by four wings for swiftness). Upon his death, his four generals divided the empire (represented by four heads).</dd>\n  <dt>THE TERRIBLE BEAST</dt>\n  <dd><strong>ROME</strong>. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims. Out of this fourth beast comes a &quot;little horn.&quot;</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>The beast of Revelation 13, and the &quot;little horn&quot; of Daniel 7, are one and the same power. One of the most fantastic things about this power is that it would think to &quot;change times and laws&quot; (Daniel 7:25). Here's a man that sets himself up as equal with God and dares tamper with God's law. He changes the calendar, the ten commandments, the Lord's supper, baptism, marriage, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Now who is the &quot;beast?&quot; What power fits all these characteristics?</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Received its &quot;seat&quot; and authority from Rome (Rev. 13:4).</li>\n  <li>Rules the world for 1260 years (533 A.D. - 1793 A.D.).</li>\n  <li>Received a deadly wound which later heals (Rev. 13:3).</li>\n  <li>Is both a political and religious power, which is worshipped (Rev. 13:4).</li>\n  <li>Tampered with God's law (Daniel 7:25).</li>\n  <li>Has a leader who claims to be God on the earth and to be able to forgive sins (Rev. 13:1, 2 Thes. 2:4).</li>\n  <li>Is a mother church (Rev. 17:5).</li>\n  <li>Made war with the saints (Rev. 13:7).</li>\n  <li>Is a world power that is wondered at (Rev. 13:3,4).</li>\n  <li>Has &quot;a man&quot; at the head of it with the number of his name being 666 (Rev. 13:18).</li>\n  <li>Has an &quot;image&quot; made to it (Rev. 13:14).</li>\n  <li>Has a dreaded &quot;mark&quot; which, if received, will cause a person to be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 14:9,10).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By now most people have guessed that it's the <strong>Papacy</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Unveiling Rome, the Caesars, and the Mystery of 666</h2>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.</blockquote>\n<p>There has never been a nation on earth except Rome that meets the requirements of this chapter. What John saw was a nation rising from a chaotic condition of many nations. The ten horns represent the 10 kingdoms over which she ruled:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>German empire</li>\n  <li>Austrian Empire</li>\n  <li>Belgium</li>\n  <li>Holland</li>\n  <li>France</li>\n  <li>Spain</li>\n  <li>Italy</li>\n  <li>Switzerland</li>\n  <li>Portugal</li>\n  <li>Great Britain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This Beast has passed through seven heads of Government:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>7 Kings ruled for about 200 years</li>\n  <li>Consuls</li>\n  <li>Tribunes</li>\n  <li>Decemvirs</li>\n  <li>Dictators</li>\n  <li>65 Emperors ruled in Rome for 5 centuries</li>\n  <li>Exarchs of Ravenna ruled for more than a century</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.</blockquote>\n<p>The leopard is distinguished for its bloodthirstiness and cruelty. The dragon (Pagan Rome) gave him (Papal Rome) his seat (Rome) and his power (absolute rulership) and great authority. <strong>THE VATICAN OCCUPIES THE ORIGINAL GARDENS OF NERO!</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast.</blockquote>\n<p>The sixth head was wounded unto death when the old Pagan power collapsed, but the deadly wound was healed and the seventh head comes to power in the form of the Exarchs of Ravenna who will rule for more than a century.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, 'Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?'</blockquote>\n<p>Roman Catholicism brought the idols of paganism into their church with them. It is the same beast in another form. The Roman Catholic church maintained a large Army and Navy during the dark ages and made war against the saints.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:5-6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies... He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.</blockquote>\n<p>Let's look at the claims of the Popes and see if they are blasphemous:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>He claims to be head of the church. But Scripture says Christ is the head (Col 1:18).</li>\n  <li>The Pope claims that he is the Judge of the Living and the Dead (Cath. Ency. XV. page 126).</li>\n  <li>Authority above all and subject to none (Pius VI Ency. 65).</li>\n  <li>&quot;We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.&quot; (Leo. XIII Ency, 304).</li>\n  <li>The <strong>Vicar of Christ</strong>. The Pope has this inscription on his crown: <strong>VICARIUS FILII DEI</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Letter</th>\n      <th>Value</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>V</td><td>5</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>I</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>C</td><td>100</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>A</td><td>0</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>R</td><td>0</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>I</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>V</td><td>5</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>S</td><td>0</td></tr>\n    <tr><td><strong>Subtotal</strong></td><td><strong>112</strong></td></tr>\n    <tr><td>F</td><td>0</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>I</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>L</td><td>50</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>I</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>I</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td><strong>Subtotal</strong></td><td><strong>53</strong></td></tr>\n    <tr><td>D</td><td>500</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>E</td><td>0</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>I</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td><strong>Subtotal</strong></td><td><strong>501</strong></td></tr>\n    <tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>666</strong></td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them...</blockquote>\n<p>Rome's long history was marked with the shedding of the blood of saints. In 1208 Pope Innocent III warred against the Waldenses and Albigenses, in which one million perished. Historians estimate that the persecuting hands of Rome have been reddened by the blood of fifty million saints.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon.</blockquote>\n<p>The first beast (Imperial Rome) came up out of the sea of humanity. The second beast (Papal Rome) came up out of the earth (World of religion).</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.</blockquote>\n<p>Let us take a look at old Rome and compare it with new Rome and you will see that Catholics worship the Pagan system:</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>OLD ROME HAD</th>\n      <th>NEW ROME HAS</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Pontifex Maximus</td><td>Supreme Pontiff</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Purgatory</td><td>Purgatory</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Priests and Priestesses</td><td>Priest and Nuns</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Victims</td><td>Victims</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Hosts</td><td>Hosts</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Lustral Water</td><td>Holy Water</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Vestal Virgins</td><td>Nuns</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Pantheon</td><td>Vatican</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Worshiped dead heroes</td><td>Worshiped Dead Saints</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Goddesses</td><td>Lordesses</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Demi-Gods</td><td>Angels</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Revelation 13:18</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.</blockquote>\n<p>No number can be correct unless it applies equally to the <strong>man</strong> and the <strong>kingdom</strong>. The founder of the Latin Kingdom was <strong>LATEINOS</strong>, the letters of whose name make exactly the 666. Here they are in their true numerical value:</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <caption>LATEINOS (Founder of the Latins)</caption>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>L</td><td>30</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>A</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>T</td><td>300</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>E</td><td>5</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>I</td><td>10</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>N</td><td>50</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>O</td><td>70</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>S</td><td>200</td></tr>\n    <tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>666</strong></td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>This number identifies the Pope as the Head of the Catholic Church. He wears a crown with the inscription <strong>Vicarius Filii Dei</strong>, which also sums to 666. Thus, the prophecy belongs to the kingdom of Imperial Rome and Papal Rome.</p>",
