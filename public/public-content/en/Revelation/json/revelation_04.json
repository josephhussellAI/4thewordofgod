  "title": "The Heavenly Coronation: God on the Throne of Glory",
  "content": "<p>Come with me and we will see the grand inauguration. First we are introduced to the <strong>Majesty On High</strong>–God himself is described in resplendent glory. Then we are introduced to heaven's ruling class, the twenty-four elders. What were they preparing for? None other than the coronation.</p>\n<p>Heaven's ballroom is filled with guests, no one had ever seen anything this elegant, excitement was in the air, praises were emanating from celestial beings. Then came the great announcement: The Lion of the tribe of Judah, The Lamb of God, The Root of David had appeared–The throne room was filled with applause. Lightning, Thunder, and voices–It was a \"heavenly fireworks\" seraphim and cherubim led in the \"glory chorus\" of Holy, Holy, Holy. They were proclaiming that Jesus the creator was worthy to receive power, honor and glory, for he had created all things.</p>\n\n<h2>Experience the Majesty of Heaven's Grand Inauguration</h2>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, 'Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.'</blockquote>\n<p>It was fitting for John to describe what he saw in heaven before he begins the recital of the great events that were about to be enacted. This chapter is given entirely to the setting forth the occupants and forces of heaven who were to direct all of the coming events. He first describes in symbolic language what he saw. We must bear in mind that the language is highly figurative even to the throne for that was only \"set\" in heaven, like the \"movies,\" where everything is set for the panorama that follows. First we see a door standing open and just through the door we get a glimpse of the triune God with all his attendants. Wow! What a scene. Like the sound of a trumpet a voice says come up hither, and I will reveal to you the future.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ezek. 1:1:</strong> In the [Or my] thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.</blockquote>\n<p>Enraptured John's flesh no longer hinders his vision and senses.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>II Cor. 12:1:</strong> I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>John sees the royal seat of God and Christ and describes his radiance and splendor.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.</blockquote>\n<p>In the heavenly scene God appeared like the crystalline brightness of Jasper and the fiery Sardis stone:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Jasper:</strong> A precious stone–quartz like, variegated with divers colors, some sea green dazzling in brilliance.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sardine stone (Carnelian):</strong> Blood red in color.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ezek 1:26-28:</strong> Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire... This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.</blockquote>\n<p>If these elders are the 12 patriarchs and the 12 apostles then the resurrection had taken place before John begins his recital of the great events given in panoramic form which is unthinkable. The Twentieth Century New Testament gives the name <strong>councilors</strong> instead of the name elders. These 24 are the <strong>ruling aristocracy of heaven</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dan. 7:9-14:</strong> As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat... The court was seated, and the books were opened.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits [Or the sevenfold Spirit] of God.</blockquote>\n<p>Out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunder. These are symbols of <strong>God's proclamations</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ex. 19:16-20:</strong> On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the <strong>seven spirits of God</strong>. These seven lamps burning before the throne symbolized the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong>. Observe Solomon's throne:</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I Kings 10:18-20:</strong> Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with fine gold...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:6-7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.</blockquote>\n<p>And before the throne there was a sea of glass. Like a sheet of ice (NEB). Four beasts full of eyes before and behind. They are four <strong>seraphim</strong> or <strong>Cherubim</strong>. The same as Ezekiel and Isaiah saw. They are attendants of God and the workers of his purposes and judgments.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 6:2:</strong> Above him were seraphs, each with six wings...</li>\n<li><strong>Ezek. 1:5-6:</strong> and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.'</blockquote>\n<p>All of this symbolizes that God's government is sovereign, firm, enduring, intelligent and rapid in its execution. That God is past, present, future, eternal, and everlasting.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa. 6:3:</strong> And they were calling to one another: \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Revelation 4:9-11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: 'You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.'</blockquote>",
