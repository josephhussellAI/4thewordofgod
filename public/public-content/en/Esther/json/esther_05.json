  "content": "<p>Esther has psyched herself up, dressed herself in a costume befitting the presence of a king, a little spray of perfume, and nervous as a caged lion as she walks toward the throne room the king can see her coming from a distance. He holds out the <strong>golden scepter</strong>. They make eye contact and touch for just a moment and then he wants to know what’s happening and what she wanted. I’d give you <strong>half of the kingdom</strong> if you want it but to his surprise she wants a dinner engagement. How about tonight? This chapter is filled with suspense and anticipation. Fasten your seat belt and join me in the exposition.</p>\n\n<h2>Exploring the Golden Scepter and the Trap of Pride</h2>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</blockquote>\n<p>Three days of fasting, (<strong>fasting</strong> is the prelude to prayer) and thought preparation she puts off her mourning attire and dresses in her royal attire, at first she was scared to death but now she is bold and daring. Two security men move into position—one miss move on the part of Esther and her head would be loped off and rolling across the pavement.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</blockquote>\n<p>She was uninvited but not unprepared…Esther was as worried as a mouse in cat country. The king is flanked on the right and left with advisors and court personnel. She had gained his attention by her very presence and demeanor.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</blockquote>\n<p>The king readily tells her that whatever she desires—anything she wants even up to <strong>half-of-the-kingdom</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</blockquote>\n<p>The king has no idea what she has come to the throne room for but Esther wants the king and Haman to come to her <strong>banquet</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</blockquote>\n<p>The king orders his assistants to go and tell Haman to get dressed for a banquet over at the queen’s residence.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</blockquote>\n<p>After small talk and enjoying the luscious meal it was customary to sip some wine and eat some fruit and nuts—the king is curious as to what Esther has up her sleeve and again he repeats his up-to-half–the-kingdom offer.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</blockquote>\n<p>She is going to keep him in suspense by putting him off till tomorrow.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</blockquote>\n<p>One invitation leads to another and one can only imagine the apprehension that the king is experiencing at this moment.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</blockquote>\n<p>Haman has been enjoying this special treatment but when Mordecai was oblivious to him that was his “fly in the buttermilk.”</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</blockquote>\n<p>Haman was furious but he kept his frenzy bottled up till he could talk it over with his friends and his wife.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</blockquote>\n<p>Haman went home to “sing his own praises” he brags with some big talk about money—his children his promotion—it was all big talk.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</blockquote>\n<p>Haman is still “blowing his own horn” he is crowing but before tomorrow he will be eating crow.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</blockquote>\n<p>The only thought that enters his mind is how to get rid of <strong>Mordecai</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Esther 5:14</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</blockquote>\n<p>Haman sends for the kingdom construction crew to erect a 75 foot <strong>gallows</strong> and plans to speak to the king early tomorrow morning about this insubordinate employee at the entrance gate.</p>",
