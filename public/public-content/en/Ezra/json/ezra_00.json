  "content": "<h2>Background</h2><p>There was no TV coverage—no newspapers. But heralds were sent to all parts of the kingdom to announce the news. The king had issued an edict allowing the Jews to return from Persia to their homeland.</p><p>The first contingent, which consisted of 42,360 people led by Zerubbabel, returned in BC 536. In BC 458, Ezra led another group the long journey back to their homeland, and finally, a third group left Persia under the leadership of Nehemiah in BC 445. The book of Ezra will tell us of the first two returns, and the book of Nehemiah will guide us through the third return.</p><p>These are moments in history that capture our attention. Babylon had held the Jewish war captives for 70 years; but in BC 536, Persia, under Cyrus and Darius, overthrew the Babylonians. Cyrus’s decree let the Jewish exiles return home under Zerubbabel to rebuild the temple of their God. By the year of BC 530, the temple foundation was laid.</p><p>The book of Ezra will tell us in detail how the work of rebuilding was stopped. The books of Haggai and Zechariah and Malachi relate the inspiration given the Jewish people to finish the building project. Ezra is the main character of this book, and I will explore in detail his work. Enjoy the book and let it stir your spiritual passion.</p>",
