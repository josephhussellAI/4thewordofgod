  "content": "<p>Michael the archangel has played an important role in chapters nine through twelve of this book. Every one who is written in the <strong>book of life</strong> will have everlasting life and the wicked will have shame and everlasting contempt. There will be a general resurrection of the dead and Jesus shall judge the world. In the meantime, we who are wise need to shine brightly and turn many to righteousness.</p><p>Daniel was told to seal the book. Daniel sees two standing on each side of the river and the one that was clothed in linen stood on the waters and swore that it shall be for <strong>time, times, and one half time</strong>. That is, that the time of Antichous was over. Cf. verse 11 the time of the abomination was over with. Finally, Daniel would rest with his fathers till resurrection day.</p><h2>Embracing the Promise of Resurrection and Future Glory</h2><h3>Daniel 12:1</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</blockquote><p>The <strong>time of trouble</strong> has been verified and elaborated upon in the previous chapters and that the time referred to was fulfilled under the <strong>Maccabean era</strong> is further confirmed in verse eleven of this chapter.</p><p>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. (1 Thess. 4:16-18)</p><p>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the <strong>book of life</strong>: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. (Rev. 20:12)</p><h3>Daniel 12:2</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</blockquote><p>At the present time every child of God has <strong>eternal life (In Trust)</strong>; when we are resurrected we will be immortal and have everlasting life. We have an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved (In Trust) in heaven for you.</p><p>To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. (I Peter 1:4)</p><p>Some will go to shame and everlasting contempt:</p><p>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. (John 5:28,29)</p><h3>Daniel 12:3</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</blockquote><p>The Psalmist said, The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork. (Psalm 19:1)</p><p>The major constellations, planets and stars are viewed as being vehicles of God’s <strong>natural revelation</strong> and are examined with a view to deciphering the glory of our Creator. So we are to be a witness to the accuracy of prophetic truths given through God’s <strong>special revelation</strong>, the Bible.</p><h3>Daniel 12:4</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</blockquote><p>Shut up the words, and seal the book. That is equal to saying (the end). There are twelve chapters and there will never be a thirteenth chapter. Knowledge shall be increased.</p><p>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. (Isa 11:9)</p><p>We live in the <strong>information age</strong>. Today the knowledge of the word is running to and fro throughout the world. There is a general diffusion of the light of truth being sent thru the world.</p><h3>Daniel 12:5</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.</blockquote><p>In Daniel 8:2,3,6, he has a vision and in the vision Daniel was by the river Ulai. The vision was regarding the ram which had two horns and the goat with one horn. Then in chapter ten Daniel is beside the river Hiddekel and has a vision that covers the remaining of chapter ten and all of eleven.</p><h3>Daniel 12:6</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</blockquote><p>Now two are standing, one on the waters of the river and the other on the bank of the river, their conversation was regarding “how long to the end of these wonders?”</p><h3>Daniel 12:7</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</blockquote><p>The answer was crouched in symbolic language. In chapter eight and verse 14 Daniel is told that the transgression of <strong>Antiochus Epiphanes</strong> will cover a period of 2300 days—171-165 B.C. The period of Antiochus’ abominations. It would appear, however, during this period that time (a revolution = 360 and times 2 revolutions = 720 and ½ time 180 the sum total being 1260) was the period that the temple was used for heathen sacrifices, B.C. 168-165. As I examined the verse it didn’t occur to me that there was any discussion regarding the dark ages or the end of the world, but rather to the things regarding the “holy people” and the finishing of the things related in chapter ten and eleven.</p><h3>Daniel 12:8</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?</blockquote><p>Daniel had his answer, but couldn’t put it all together. He still didn’t know how it would play out.</p><h3>Daniel 12:9</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</blockquote><p>“Go thy way” Just another way of saying, \"stop asking questions.\" This revelation is kept secret until the crisis comes to an end, therefore none will understand it before the proper time. I remind the reader that chapter ten and eleven was fulfilled as you read the historical accounts that have been written.</p><h3>Daniel 12:10</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</blockquote><p>Most of us want to be purified and made white but few want to be tried. In order for silver to be purified it has to be put into a furnace and heated to extreme temperature and the dross will come to the top and the silversmith will remove all the impurity, so it is with those who are purified. We must be purified in the <strong>furnace of affliction</strong>. We must be tried as the tinsel strength of a rope is tried to see if it will hold the load. The wicked don’t have a clue, they read and read. Even after reading it they still didn’t get it.</p><h3>Daniel 12:11</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.</blockquote><blockquote>At the same time that Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, had a quarrel with the sixth Ptolemy about his right to the whole country of Syria, a great sedition fell among the men of power in Judea... The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army... He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months. — Josephus</blockquote><p>Notice that I underlined the words <strong>three years and six months which equals 1260 days</strong>. This was the time that the temple was used for heathen sacrifices. It is further clear from the above scripture that he is not talking about the end of the world but the end of the occupation of Antiochus and the period of time that the temple was profaned and the abomination upon the altar.</p><p>Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side.</p><p>The 30 days difference between the 1260 days and the 1290 days may be accounted for by the use of different calendars or the beginning and ending of the heathen practice.</p><h3>Daniel 12:12</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.</blockquote><p>I believe that the <em>1260</em> days which is the same as 3 years and 6 months mentioned by Josephus is the exact length of time that the heathen sacrifices were offered on the altar and that the other two periods of 30 days and the additional 45 days has to do with the clean-up and rededication of the temple.</p><h3>Daniel 12:13</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.</blockquote><p>Daniel, you keep on going till the end of your days and you will rest till the resurrection and then you will rise again.</p>",
