  "content": "<p>The song continues from the previous chapter─picture Jerusalem as a ruin and the Jews as Babylonian slaves. Somehow they dust off the pages of Isaiah and flick through the writings and hope arises like smoke from a furnace. It’s hugging time─it’s all over─they’ve had a double discipline. God is flattening the mountains and filling the valleys and the cavalcade will be arriving soon. It’s planting time and reconstruction of their homes and cities from ruins. And as a bonus God is taking care of their enemies he is going to slay the dragon by the sea and punish leviathan the piercing serpent. Try the exposition for more detail.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncovering the Defeat of Leviathan and Israel’s Restoration</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.</blockquote>\n<p>The prophets often compared tyrannical kingdoms to serpents, dragons, and leviathan. Daniel saw four beasts that came out of the sea and were unlike each other (Dan 7:3-7). The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings, the second was like a bear with three ribs in its mouth, the third was like a leopard with four wings and four heads, the fourth was diverse from all the others and had ten horns. (All four of these creatures represented four kingdoms, namely Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece and the Roman Empire.)</p>\n<p>Leviathan, Lion with eagle’s wings, bear with three ribs in its mouth, leopard with four wings and four heads, and a nondescript animal with seven heads and ten horns are symbolic creatures representing the arrogant, turbulent world governments in revolt against God. Wolves and lambs feeding together represent kingdoms at peace with each other. The prophets speak of lions, snakes and ferocious animals, such as a red dragon with seven heads and seven crowns as representing the kingdoms that were devoid of spiritual understanding.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 65:25:</strong> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Psa 74:14; Psa 104:26; Isa 51:9; Isa 51:9; Eze 29:3; Jer 51:34; Rev 12:3; Rev 20:2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.</blockquote>\n<p>The prophet paints a different picture from the destruction of leviathan (leviathan was Babylon) to Israel once again in their homeland planting a vineyard and raising grapes and making red wine.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 5:1:</strong> Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Psa 80:8; Jer 2:21; Mat 21:33</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</blockquote>\n<p>God promises to water the vineyard. (Israel, which he continually represents as a vineyard planted by the Lord.) He brought them out of Egypt, planted them in the Holy Land and removed the noxious weeds of heathenism and nurtured them day and night.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eze 37:14:</strong> And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Deu 33:26-29; 1Sa 2:9; Isa 35:6-7</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.</blockquote>\n<p>The song continues with the words that God is no longer angry with her even if there are thistles and thorn bushes he will gather them out and burn them.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 12:1:</strong> And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.</li>\n<li><strong>Psa 85:3:</strong> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.</blockquote>\n<p>They were told to take hold of the strength that God offered them like a vine climbing a wall and clinging to the surface of the clay.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 25:4:</strong> For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Eph 2:16-17; Col 1:20</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.</blockquote>\n<p>He is going to put down fresh roots and bloom like a fruitful tree and once again repopulate the land with their offspring.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 37:31:</strong> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</li>\n<li><strong>Hos 14:5:</strong> I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</li>\n<li><strong>Zec 10:8-9:</strong> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 49:20-23; Isa 60:22</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?</blockquote>\n<p>Even though God had been hard on them in exile he had been harder on his enemies. He blew them away like an east wind from the desert. A remnant of Israel returned from the nations where he had scattered her and he bound up her bruises and healed her but her enemies were brought to a full end.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 30:11-16:</strong> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Jer 50:33-34</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.</blockquote>\n<p>There was some good news─Israel’s guilt was taken away─her sin was removed, she had survived the exile.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jdg 10:10-16:</strong> ...And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day. And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Psa 38:1; Jer 10:24</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.</blockquote>\n<p>The evidence that Jacob is purged and all her sins forgiven are this: God is going to tear down the pagan altars stone by stone and the sex-and-religion shrines will be dismantled.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2Ch 34:4:</strong> And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 48:10; Pro 20:30; Eze 24:13; Mal 3:2-4; Isa 2:20-21; Isa 17:8</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.</blockquote>\n<p>Further evidence of God’s forgiveness will be the defenced cities of the heathen will be desolate with no one living there anymore─animals will lie down in their ruins and browse on the branches of their shrubbery.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 32:13-14:</strong> Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city: Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 6:11-12; Isa 64:10; Jer 26:18; Lam 2:5-9</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.</blockquote>\n<p>What was once lovely trees in their lawns are now nothing but dead branches that are gathered for fire wood. The prophet describes these people as a people with no understanding─a people with no sense of God. God will have nothing to do with them─no mercy from God─no favor from the almighty.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Joh 15:6:</strong> If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 44:18-19:</strong> They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand...</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Deu 32:18-25</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.</blockquote>\n<p>God’s anger will cause him to thresh from the Euphrates to the Nile and the children of Israel will be gathered like select grain.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deu 30:3-4:</strong> That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee...</li>\n<li><strong>Amo 9:9:</strong> For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 11:11-12</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 27:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.</blockquote>\n<p>It’s homecoming for the exiles and refugees─returning from the long seventy year sentence for their sins against God─returning to Jerusalem to the holy mount to worship.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 2:11-12:</strong> The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</li>\n<li><strong>Zec 10:8-10:</strong> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased... I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria...</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Hos 11:11; Zec 14:16</li>\n</ul>",
