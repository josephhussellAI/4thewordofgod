  "content": "<p>In 759 B.C. Isaiah saw the LORD sitting upon his throne seraphim’s were hovering above him they were singing a song about our HOLY GOD. It was an awesome scene the foundations of the temple shook and smoke filled the temple. Isaiah was terror stricken and thought it was dooms day for him─he reflects on the dirty mouth that he had but God sent a seraphim with a hot coal and touched his lips and God spoke the word of forgiveness. When God calls you to service he can clean your dirty mouth. God was looking for someone to go into the cities and villages with his message. Isaiah said, “here I am send me” he wants to know how long it will take and the Lord’s reply was till every city is emptied, every house deserted, they will all go to a prison camp and serve a life sentence. However, the tree will be cut down but it will sprout up again. All the details are awaiting you in the exposition.</p>\n\n<h2>Experience the Vision of the Holy Throne and Cleansing Coal</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 6:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Uzziah (792-740) He reigned 52 years and died at the age of 68. He was a leper for 10 years. This vision occurred in B.C. 759. Josephus (Book 9:Ch.10.Art.4) notes that while Uzziah was making preparation for futurity, he was corrupted by pride. He attempted to offer incense on the golden altar, a role reserved for priests. During the confrontation with the high priest Azariah, a great earthquake shook the ground, a rent was made in the temple, and leprosy seized the king immediately. He lived out his days as a leper while his son Jotham took the government.</p>\n<p>According to John 12:41, Isaiah saw <strong>Jesus</strong> in this vision. In this vision he sees Jesus sitting upon his throne. The train of his robe was spread out over the floor of the temple.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eze 1:26-28:</strong> And above the firmament that <em>was</em> over their heads <em>was</em> the likeness of a throne...

He thought of himself as a foul-mouthed sinner in the midst of a foul mouth people. In this vision he has seen the Lord of Heaven in his splendor and knows that no one sees God and lives to tell about it.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exo 33:20:</strong> And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</li>\n<li><strong>Jdg 13:22:</strong> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Deu 5:26; Dan 10:6-8; Rev 1:16</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 6:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> One of the seraphim’s takes a red hot glowing coal from the altar with a pair of tongs and fly’s over to where Isaiah is standing.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dan 9:21:</strong> ...even the man Gabriel... being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</li>\n<li><strong>Eze 10:2:</strong> ...fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter <em>them</em> over the city.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Rev 8:3-5; Lev 16:12</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 6:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> The seraphim touched Isaiah’s lips with the glowing hot coal and said your iniquity is now removed and your sins are forgiven.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 1:9:</strong> Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth.

They will see demonstrations and illustrations of God at work, over and over again but just don’t catch on. Isaiah will be preaching to a group of people who have a dehydrated heart.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mar 4:11-12:</strong> ...that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted...</li>\n<li><strong>Rom 11:8:</strong> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber...)</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 30:8-11</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 6:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Isaiah will make their hearts unreceptive and sluggish, their ears will be sealed and their eyes glued shut. With their wits dulled and their ears deafened and their eyelids pasted shut and their heart unreceptive there is no chance of them responding and being converted. Isaiah is like a doctor who lances a wound and it only gets worse or amputating a leg that will not heal. Now he is told that he is a messenger of judgment, an instrument in God’s hands to bring a wicked nation into a state of “non-compliance.”</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 29:10:</strong> For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep...</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Exo 10:27; Exo 14:17; Deu 2:30; Eze 3:6-11; Jer 6:10; Zec 7:11; Joh 3:19,20</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 6:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> How long will it be before they will listen? God tells Isaiah that these people are not going to change till every city is destroyed and no one living in their houses and their gardens and farms turned into an animal sanctuary.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 74:10:</strong> O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 24:1-12</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 6:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> The land will be abandoned, and the Eternal has banished the people, and they are slaves in a far away country.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2Ki 25:21:</strong> ...So Judah was carried away out of their land.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Jer 15:4; Jer 52:28-30; Jer 4:29; Jer 12:7; Rom 11:15</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 6:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> God will have a remnant─ten percent will survive─this group will be scattered and serve a life sentence in slavery but like a tree that has been cut down the holy seed will survive and be planted again in the Promised Land.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 1:9:</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <em>and</em> we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 10:20-22</li>\n</ul>",
