  "content": "<p>They had vexed God's Holy Spirit and turned to Egypt for help. Foreign aid was sent to Egypt and when Pharaoh’s army came to help defend Jerusalem they simply returned to Egypt—their help amounted to no help—she was a “do nothing” utterly useless helper. The prophet calls Israel a lying faithless brood of evildoers who tried to get their prophets to prophesy delusions. Every effort was made to shut the prophets up. Their disposal of the word caused God to let this bunch of reprobates go into captivity. War came and they were left like a flag pole without a flag. However, God is still holding out hope for them when they come to their senses. While in exile they will eat the bread of adversity and drink the water of affliction. Finally repentance takes hold and they throw away their images of silver and get right with God. He restores them to their homeland and blesses them beyond their dreams.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncovering the Futility of Trusting in the Shadow of Egypt</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</blockquote>\n<p>The scriptures make it plain that this people had from day one been rebellious. This stiff-necked self-willed generation of people who resisted the Holy Ghost was bent on a plan that was not sanctioned by the Eternal-—they were weaving a treaty with Egypt.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Act 7:51</strong> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers <em>did,</em> so <em>do</em> ye.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 30:9; Isa 63:10; Deu 9:24; Eze 3:9; 1Ch 10:13-14</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!</blockquote>\n<p>Trusting in Egypt for military aid against the Assyrians was as futile as the U.S. looking to the U.N. We have the words “IN GOD WE TRUST” on our coins, but reluctantly we seek help from other sources.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 31:1</strong> Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because <em>they are</em> many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 36:6; Deu 28:68; Jos 9:14</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.</blockquote>\n<p>Putting their trust in Egypt will bring disappointment and humiliation. Egypt was the reluctant dragon or the crockadile of the Nile.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 30:5-7</strong> They were all ashamed of a people <em>that</em> could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence <em>come</em> the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people <em>that</em> shall not profit <em>them.</em> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength <em>is</em> to sit still.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 20:5; Jer 37:5-9; Rom 10:11</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.</blockquote>\n<p>Zoan in the North and Hanes in the South─their help will amount to nothing. They were trusting in a broken reed. We learned in chapter 19 that her princes were fools.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hos 7:11-12</strong> Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 19:11; Eze 30:18; Isa 20:5-6; Isa 31:1-3</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</blockquote>\n<p>The leaders that had looked for help but found none would be ashamed that they trusted in a people that brought them nothing but disappointment. The Egyptians were all a sorry lot.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 2:36</strong> Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 31:1-3</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.</blockquote>\n<p>The donkeys and camels were all laden with foreign aid—treasures to pay for Egypt’s help—trusting in Egypt was the ruin of Israel.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deu 8:15</strong> Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, <em>wherein were</em> fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where <em>there was</em> no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Jer 11:4; Num 21:6; 2Ch 28:21-23</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.</blockquote>\n<p>“To Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing.” (NIV)</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 31:3</strong> Now the Egyptians <em>are</em> men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.</li>\n<li><strong>Lam 3:26</strong> <em>It is</em> good that <em>a man</em> should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:</blockquote>\n<p>This writing still stands as an indictment of Israel’s unbelief. God does not leave himself without witness. In time to come they will claim that “you never told us.”</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Job 19:23-24</strong> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 8:1; Jer 51:60; Hab 2:2</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:</blockquote>\n<p>This rebellious─apt at deceiving─faithless brood─seed of evildoers they wanted nothing to do with the prophet’s word.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 1:4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</li>\n<li><strong>Deu 31:27</strong> For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:</blockquote>\n<p>They wanted the prophets to prophesy delusion─ they preferred lies to truth and sought every means to shut them up. They plotted assassinations, prisons and death to silence them.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1Ki 21:20</strong> And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found <em>thee:</em> because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>1Ki 22:8; 2Ch 24:19; Jer 26:20-23</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</blockquote>\n<p>Since they despised the word of God and put their trust in wile and guile, God will give them over to a reprobate mind to do as they pleased and send a foreign nation to feed them on the bread of adversity and the water of affliction.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 29:21</strong> That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.</li>\n<li><strong>Amo 7:13</strong> But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it <em>is</em> the king's chapel, and it <em>is</em> the king's court.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Rom 1:28-30</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:</blockquote>\n<p>The prophets spared no words in describing their perverted mind set.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 5:24</strong> Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, <em>so</em> their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>2Sa 12:9-10; Isa 28:15</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.</blockquote>\n<p>Isaiah warns them that the calamity that is about to come upon them is like a bulging wall that will come crashing down upon them. In his fury and anger God will come crashing down on them.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1Ki 20:30</strong> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and <em>there</em> a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men <em>that were</em> left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Eze 13:10-15; Pro 29:1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:14</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.</blockquote>\n<p>When God finishes with them, they will be like a broken pitcher—not one piece big enough to carry coals from a fire- place or dip water from a spring.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 2:9</strong> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Jer 19:10-11; Deu 29:20</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:15</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.</blockquote>\n<p>God sought repentance and returning to him but they would have “none of it”.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 23:36</strong> And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 7:4; Isa 32:17</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:16</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.</blockquote>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 31:1</strong> Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because <em>they are</em> many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Amo 2:14-16</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:17</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.</blockquote>\n<p>When you hear the war-cry, one of them will chase a 1,000 of you. You will be scattered like a flock of ducks in gun season. You will be like a lonely tree on a mountain, like a flagpole on a hill.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lev 26:8</strong> And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</li>\n<li><strong>Lev 26:36</strong> And upon them that are left <em>alive</em> of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Deu 32:30; Isa 1:7-8; Zec 13:8-9</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:18</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.</blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless the LORD will wait that he may show his grace to you. You will be blessed if you wait for him.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rom 9:15-18</strong> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then <em>it is</em> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will <em>have mercy,</em> and whom he will he hardeneth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:19</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.</blockquote>\n<p>Weep no more! The LORD will hear your cry and answer you —the remnant will return and dwell in Zion.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 50:4-5</strong> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, <em>saying,</em> Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant <em>that</em> shall not be forgotten.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:20</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:</blockquote>\n<p>While in exile they had bread in scarcity and water in allowance —your teacher will no longer be hidden away in some remote corner but your eyes will look to him for guidance.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1Ki 22:27</strong> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <em>fellow</em> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</li>\n<li><strong>Psa 80:5</strong> Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Psa 74:9; Amo 8:11-12</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:21</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</blockquote>\n<p>If you stray from the path you will hear a voice (from your comrades) saying get back on the path and follow the right way.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 35:8</strong> And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it <em>shall be</em> for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err <em>therein.</em></li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 42:16; Isa 48:17; Isa 58:11; Psa 25:8; Psa 143:8-10; Pro 3:5-6; Jer 6:16; 1Jn 2:27; Psa 32:8</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:22</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.</blockquote>\n<p>You will throw away the graven images like dirty rags —you will say good riddance.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 2:20</strong> In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made <em>each one</em> for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>2Ch 31:1; Eze 18:6</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:23</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.</blockquote>\n<p>In that day the ground will be fertile—abundance of rain—plenty of corn—abundance of cattle.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 44:2-4</strong> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, <em>which</em> will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

Doth God take care for oxen? Or saith he <em>it</em> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <em>this</em> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:25</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.</blockquote>\n<p>In the day when God brings great slaughter to your enemies he will bring streams of water on every high hill—the flat tops of mountains, the coves and steep hill, deserts and wilderness would once again bring forth trees, and abundance of crops. When the towers fall probably refers to the siege towers or water towers in the enemy cities.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 43:19-20</strong> Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, <em>and</em> rivers in the desert.

The sieve was a large instrument, somewhat like a shovel, with a long handle, with which they tossed the corn mixed with the chaff and chopped straw into the air, that the wind might separate the chaff from the grain. When the wind wasn’t blowing they used people with fans to blow the chaff away.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 11:4</strong> But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>2Th 2:8; Luk 22:31; Heb 4:12; Rev 2:16</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:29</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.</blockquote>\n<p>Gods people will have a song to sing—like the ones sung at great celebrations—or as a trumpet player leading one on a pilgrimage.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2Ch 20:27-28</strong> Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 30:32</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.</blockquote>\n<p>After God smote them—when the battle was over they celebrated the victory with tabrets and harps and singing.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 81:1-2</strong> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of Asaph.
