  "content": "<p>With the death toll in the millions and the main populace sold into slavery a few surviving women are desperate to have a child so they are willing to practice polygamy. God blesses the land and it is filled with fruit for the escaped of Israel and their names are recorded among the living and God purifies them and they are called the holy people. God is visible by fire at night and a cloud in the day to make his presence known to the escapees.</p>\n\n<h2>Unveiling the Glory of the Branch and Holy Remnant</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 4:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</blockquote>\n<p>War had taken its toll on the population ─90% of the people had been killed and most of the male population was decimated, women suffered the awful disgrace of being widows and childless. Seven women tell one man that they will furnish their own food and clothing if he would allow the children born from her to bear his name. They want him to make them pregnant so as to take away their reproach.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gen 30:23:</strong> And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: Read: <strong>Isa 17:7</strong>; <strong>Isa 10:21</strong>; <strong>Isa 10:20</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 4:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</blockquote>\n<p>Isaiah sees the escapees from the war once again enjoying the fruit of the land. The survivors will gather in the crops and there will be an abundance of harvest.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 60:21-22:</strong> Thy people also <em>shall be</em> all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

Their names are on the register of survivors from the city’s purging.</p>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 4:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</blockquote>\n<p>God washes away the moral filth of the survivors and purges the blood guilt of Jerusalem he does it with a devastating blast of searing judgment.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eze 16:6-9:</strong> And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee <em>when thou wast</em> in thy blood, Live...
