  "content": "<p>They were quarried from the <strong>Rock</strong>─God. They are told to reflect upon their roots─<strong>Abraham and Sarah</strong>─no children but God made their offspring as numerous as the stars in multitude. God will once again bless <strong>Zion</strong>─this forsaken place will look like the garden of Eden, and as a bonus joy and gladness and singing and shouting will again spring from these ashes. His word will flow like a river─salvation will be on schedule and islands will be waiting for his justice. The new order will be like the discarding of old moth-eaten garments. They were to hold the teachings of the LORD inside them and not be afraid. They were to awake and put on the strength of the LORD because they were serving a God strong enough to destroy the crocodile of the Nile. Happy day! They have arrived home from exile, sorrow and sadness have vanished like smoke. He further assures them that those in jail and prisons would be freed and not be left behind to starve. The captives had been smitten with madness and astonishment of heart─God gave them to drink the <strong>wine of his fury</strong>. They lived for 70 years on this wine. As the time of the exile comes to an end the <strong>cup of fury</strong> is transferred from the exiles to the captors.</p>\n\n<h2>Awakening Divine Strength and Finding Comfort for Zion</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.</blockquote>\n<p>They are to look to the <strong>rock</strong> from where they had been quarried.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 46:3-4</strong> Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne <em>by me</em> from the belly, which are carried from the womb: And <em>even</em> to <em>your</em> old age I <em>am</em> he; and <em>even</em> to hoar hairs will I carry <em>you:</em> I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver <em>you.</em></li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Pro 15:9; Mat 5:6</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</blockquote>\n<p>They were to think about their ancestors─<strong>Abraham and Sarah</strong>─once Abraham was just one, he and Sarah had no children when God called him, but God blessed him and made him into a multitude.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gen 12:1-3</strong> Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</blockquote>\n<p>God will once again comfort Zion. All her piled up ruins and rubble will look like Eden─her deserted places will look like a lush garden─Joy and gladness, thanksgiving and singing and melody will be found in Zion. He will give them beauty where now is ashes and joy where now is depression.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 61:1-5</strong> The Spirit of the Lord GOD <em>is</em> upon me... to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness... And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien <em>shall be</em> your plowmen and your vinedressers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</blockquote>\n<p>When God brings deliverance to Zion his revelation will flow like a river and judgment will rest upon them and his decisions will light up the world.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 2:3</strong> And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD... for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Rom 8:2-4</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</blockquote>\n<p>Gods salvation arrived just on schedule─far away islands were waiting for his justice─his arm would bring uprightness.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 60:9</strong> Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first...</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Rom 1:16-17</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</blockquote>\n<p>When God sets things aright he compares it to discarding your old work clothes─the skies above vanishing like smoke─but his righteousness lasting forever. God setting-things-right will never be obsolete.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deu 4:19</strong> And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven...</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 34:4</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</blockquote>\n<p>If you hold the teachings of the LORD inside you─don’t be afraid of scorn, reviling, taunts or insults─don’t let it get you down─do not be afraid of their words, nor dismayed at their looks.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 37:31</strong> The law of his God <em>is</em> in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</li>\n<li><strong>Eze 2:6</strong> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them... nor be dismayed at their looks, though they <em>be</em> a rebellious house.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</blockquote>\n<p>They will be gone like a moth eaten garment is discarded or like a termite eaten board is burned.

Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</blockquote>\n<p>They are told to awake and put on strength─didn’t you once destroy <strong>Rahab</strong> (Egypt) and didn’t you once pierce the <strong>dragon</strong> (symbol of Egypt). Pharaoh was the crocodile of the Nile.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eze 29:3</strong> Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <em>am</em> against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers...</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 59:17; Isa 27:1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</blockquote>\n<p>Wasn’t it the God who lives within you─who guides you, that turned the red sea into a highway for the passing of the redeemed?</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 63:11</strong> Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, <em>and</em> his people, <em>saying,</em> Where <em>is</em> he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock?...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</blockquote>\n<p>Happy day!

I dwell in the high and holy <em>place,</em> with him also <em>that is</em> of a contrite and humble spirit...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</blockquote>\n<p>They had forgotten God their maker─the one who spread the stars across the skies─they feared the oppressor every day as if he was going to destroy them. They shook like a leaf in the wind at the tantrums of this tyrant.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deu 32:18</strong> Of the Rock <em>that</em> begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 8:12-13</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:14</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.</blockquote>\n<p>These captives are going to be set free and will not be left behind to starve or rot in some prison.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zec 9:11</strong> As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein <em>is</em> no water.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Lam 3:53-54; Isa 52:2</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:15</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.</blockquote>\n<p>More assurance that the LORD of hosts who divided the Red Sea will come to their rescue.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 31:35</strong> Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day... which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts <em>is</em> his name:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:16</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</blockquote>\n<p>God put his word in their mouth─protected them from their enemy─in the shadow of his hand (you have to be close to be in the presence of his shadow.)</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 48:13</strong> Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: <em>when</em> I call unto them, they stand up together.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 59:21</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 51:17</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.</blockquote>\n<p>God had smitten them with madness, blindness, and astonishment of heart─they had drunk the dregs of trembling.
