  "content": "<p>God had called <strong>Cyrus</strong> before his birth and made him sharp as a sword. His words penetrated from mainland to islands. His commission was to restore the exile—yes even more he would be a <strong>light to the nations</strong> of the world. He tells him that kings will stand at attention when he passes by. God says “I am sending you to re-establish Israel and bring the prisoners out of the dungeons.\" God says he will provide the pasture for his sheep, water for the thirsty, level the road ahead and gather the remnant from the north, west, and south. East was not mentioned because they were in the East. The prisoners were told to shout and sing and that even the mountains would reverberate with songs. God lets them know that he had not deserted or forgotten them—he had their name <strong>embossed on his hand</strong> and a picture of Zion’s walls in ruins ever before him. God says that even the abandoned land will again be fertile and soon overcrowded as they repopulate. Finally, he pictures for them kings and queens returning the orphaned children—tyrants are tamed and captives freed.</p>\n\n<h2>Embracing the Light to the Gentiles and Restoring Zion</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.</blockquote>\n<p>The coastlands and islands were to pay heed to this message. God had called Cyrus from before he was born and had given him a name. Notice that in verse 5 the servant has a mission for Israel.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 60:9:</strong> Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 66:19:</strong> And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, <em>to</em> Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, <em>to</em> Tubal, and Javan, <em>to</em> the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;</blockquote>\n<p>God used Cyrus’s words like a <strong>sharp sword</strong> to slay people. The word of God is sharper than a two-edged blade. His speech would cut and penetrate. He made him like an arrow with a polished shaft. The doctrine of the gospel pierced the hearts of its hearers, \"bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.\"</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 50:4:</strong> The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to <em>him that is</em> weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.</li>\n<li><strong>Hos 6:5:</strong> Therefore have I hewed <em>them</em> by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <em>are as</em> the light <em>that</em> goeth forth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</blockquote>\n<p>Israel was God’s servant and was destined to bring glory to God.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 43:21:</strong> This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 53:10:</strong> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put <em>him</em> to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see <em>his</em> seed, he shall prolong <em>his</em> days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.</blockquote>\n<p>Israel had labored in vain—spent their strength on idols and heathen religion so their judgment was of the LORD.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 65:2:</strong> I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way <em>that was</em> not good, after their own thoughts;</li>\n<li><strong>Mat 23:37:</strong> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, <em>thou</em> that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under <em>her</em> wings, and ye would not!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.</blockquote>\n<p>The servant was to gather the outcast of Jacob and to bring them back in the fold.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 56:8:</strong> The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather <em>others</em> to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</li>\n<li><strong>Rom 15:8:</strong> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises <em>made</em> unto the fathers:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</blockquote>\n<p>This servant was to raise up the tribes and restore the Jews to their homeland and to <strong>enlighten the Gentiles</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 42:6:</strong> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 11:10:</strong> And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.</li>\n<li><strong>Luk 2:32:</strong> A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.</blockquote>\n<p>When he appeared kings got to their feet and fell in homage to him.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 60:3:</strong> And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.</li>\n<li><strong>Psa 72:10-11:</strong> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.</blockquote>\n<p>The jail bars were broken and the <strong>prisoners were freed</strong> to return to their home place—the Gentile nations supplied them with food as they crossed the mountains.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 61:1:</strong> The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;</li>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Read Psa 107:10-16; Col 1:13; 1Pe 2:9</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</blockquote>\n<p>This is a poetical way of saying that all their food supplies would be taken care of as they made the long journey to the homeland.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mat 5:6:</strong> Blessed <em>are</em> they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</li>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Read Joh 6:35; Rev 7:16-17; Psa 121:5-6; Eze 34:23</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</blockquote>\n<p>They will find shade from the sun and shelter from the cold—he sent road workers’ ahead to prepare for the wagons and pack animals to pass easily.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 35:8-10:</strong> And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness...</li>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Read Luk 3:4-6</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 49:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</blockquote>\n<p>The exiles flowed in from the four corners—north, south, east and west.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 11:10-11:</strong> And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse...
