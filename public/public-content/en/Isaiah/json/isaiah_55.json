  "title": "The Free Banquet and the Everlasting Covenant",
  "content": "<p>Free! God spread a banquet for the exiles─He provided the nourishment for their physical needs and their soul food. All of this was provided by abundant harvests─ample rains and fertile fields. He renewed the <strong>Davidistic covenant</strong> and made them a witness for all nations. Israel became a model for the Gentile countries and the Gentiles flowed into Israel. The prophet tells them that all who seek God will find him, he is near to all who call upon him. He calls for the lawless and wicked to cast off their wicked ways and obtain a full pardon. The plan was not devised by puny man but the Creator. It was enriched with wisdom and knowledge past finding out. As rain and snow provide ample moisture for all plant life so the <strong>word of God</strong> provides the seeker the spiritual food for his soul. The exiles left Babylon with joy and gladness─he pictures a people whose sadness had turned to joy, of depression and prison with praise─a people filled with the spirit of God, sanctified and justified─of wolf and lambs, leopards and goats, lions and calves lying together. The crocodile of the Nile and the serpent of the Euphrates had been destroyed.</p>\n\n<h2>Discovering the Free Banquet and Everlasting Covenant</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 55:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</blockquote>\n<p>It’s free! Great religious experiences are compared to a banquet─<strong>wine and milk</strong> symbolizes abundance and this could be purchased without cash, credit card or check.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Rev 21:6:</strong> And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.</li>\n  <li><strong>1Co 3:2:</strong> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <em>to bear it,</em> neither yet now are ye able.</li>\n  <li><strong>1Pe 2:2:</strong> As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</li>\n  <li><strong>Pro 1:21-23:</strong> Read</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 55:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</blockquote>\n<p>Let your soul delight in the rich nourishment of bread, wine, and milk. God is bringing the exiles back and is providing verdant fields, ample rains, watered gardens, seed time and harvest and <strong>soul food</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Psa 36:8:</strong> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</li>\n  <li><strong>Jer 2:13; Hos 8:7; Hos 12:1:</strong> Read</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 55:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</blockquote>\n<p>Take note and pay attention─open your ears wide─I am renewing the <strong>everlasting covenant</strong> that I made with David.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Eze 37:24-25:</strong> And David my servant <em>shall be</em> king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.

The depth of the riches both of <strong>wisdom and knowledge</strong> is past finding out.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Psa 103:11:</strong> For as the heaven is high above the earth, <em>so</em> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mat 11:25:</strong> At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rom 11:31-36:</strong> ...O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <em>are</em> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 55:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:</blockquote>\n<p>Rain and snow accomplish their job by providing what is necessary for the growing season─not only providing seed but food for the hungry.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isa 5:6:</strong> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</li>\n  <li><strong>Deu 32:2:</strong> My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 55:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</blockquote>\n<p>The rain and snow make the land fertile and fruitful so the word that passes the lips of God carries out its purpose. His powerful word is sharper than a surgeon’s scalpel, it cuts and penetrates through ones doubts and fears─no one can escape the power of <strong>God’s word</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Mat 24:35:</strong> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</li>\n  <li><strong>Luk 8:11:</strong> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</li>\n  <li><strong>Joh 6:63:</strong> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, <em>they</em> are spirit, and <em>they</em> are life.</li>\n  <li><strong>1Th 2:13:</strong> For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received <em>it</em> not <em>as</em> the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</li>\n  <li><strong>1Pe 1:23:</strong> Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 55:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.</blockquote>\n<p>The exiles left Babylon with joy and gladness, sorrow and sadness had all passed away.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isa 35:10:</strong> And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rom 15:13:</strong> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 55:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.</blockquote>\n<p>The prophet paints a picture of a people whose sadness had turned to joy─of depression replaced with praise─of knowledge replacing ignorance, of a people filled with the spirit of God, sanctified and justified─of wolf and lambs, leopards and goats, lions and calves lying together.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isa 11:6-9:</strong> The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid... They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</li>\n</ul>",
