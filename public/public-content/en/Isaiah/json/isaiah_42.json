  "content": "<p>The <strong>Messiah</strong> is coming─the spirit of the LORD is on him─he is anointed to preach good tidings, fix peoples broken hearts, release captives and open prison doors. He will not arrive with a gaudy parade or vocal demonstration. He will not turn down people who are crushed and hurting. He will restore the relationship with God by the cross. All of this is by the creator of the heavens. The one who provides all that is vital to life, God assures the Messiah that he will hold his right hand and make him a covenant to the <strong>Gentile world</strong>. He will open the eyes of the blind and the doors of the prison of unbelief.</p>\n<p>This chapter sets us up for future prophesy. God claims he knows everything from the beginning to the end and when he reveals the newest prophecy all of the mountains and islands will join in praising him. First he tells us of some of the amazing things he will do in nature and tells us the end result of idols. He reveals that the exiles are to be let out of their prison houses. The main part of the prophecy is reserved for chapter 45.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncovering the Chosen Servant: Light and Deliverer of the Blind</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</blockquote>\n<p>My servant, the <strong>Messiah</strong>, the one I have chosen─he is my heart’s delight. I have bestowed upon him my spirit─justice will shine through him to the Gentiles.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mat 12:18</strong> Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</li>\n<li><strong>Eph 3:8</strong> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</blockquote>\n<p>He will not scream nor cause a street demonstration. No loud speeches or gaudy parades.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mat 12:16-20</strong> And charged them that they should not make him known: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet... He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets...</li>\n<li><strong>Luk 17:20</strong> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</blockquote>\n<p>A <strong>bruised reed</strong> is a picture of a person who has a crushed spirit─living in heaviness and hurting on the inside. <strong>Smoking flax</strong> is a person who is about to give up─little or no hope left in him. The Messiah came to bring forth judgment and set things right.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 61:1-3</strong> The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted...</li>\n<li><strong>Mat 12:20</strong> A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</blockquote>\n<p>He won’t give up─tire out─or quit. He will restore man’s relationship with God and the whole world will wait for his law.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Joh 17:4-5</strong> I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do...</li>\n<li><strong>Heb 12:2</strong> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith...</li>\n<li><strong>Zec 2:11</strong> And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</blockquote>\n<p>This is our God─creator of heavens─stretched them out till no man can tell how far they reach─spread out the earth with its vegetation─gives us the vital air we breathe and spirit to those who live.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 45:12</strong> I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens...</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 45:18</strong> For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it...</li>\n<li><strong>Psa 24:1-2</strong> The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof...</li>\n<li><strong>Act 17:25</strong> Neither is worshipped with men's hands... seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</blockquote>\n<p>I am God and I have a firm hold on your right hand. You will be my covenant and light to the <strong>Gentile world</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 23:5-6</strong> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch... and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</li>\n<li><strong>Rom 3:25-26</strong> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood...</li>\n<li><strong>Act 26:23</strong> That Christ should suffer... and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</blockquote>\n<p>Literally Jesus opened eyes and from a figurative standpoint we were in darkness and in a prison of unbelief till Jesus set us free.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Joh 9:39</strong> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 42:22; Isa 61:1; 1Pe 2:9</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</blockquote>\n<p>God says that he is LORD and that it is his name, therefore we call upon the Lord for help. He further informs us that he will not tolerate giving his praise to graven images.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exo 20:3-5</strong> Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image... for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 42:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</blockquote>\n<p>Only God can tell things in advance. All of his former predictions have come true, so now he is going to tell the future before it becomes history. God is able to tell the end from the beginning.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gen 15:12-16</strong> ...And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs...
