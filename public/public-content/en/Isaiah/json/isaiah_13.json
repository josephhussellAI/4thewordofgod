The prophet was assigned to lay their fate before them. In the year of 606 B.C. <strong>Nebuchadnezzar</strong> attacked Jerusalem with his war machine. Babylon dates back to the time of <strong>Nimrod</strong>, and Genesis eleven gives us the story of the tower of Babel where the languages derived. This place was called Babel because people began to talk in different languages and it sounded like babbling, hence the word Babel. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts.</p>\n<p>This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar, it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world. On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The great mound called Babel by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high.</li>\n<li>The Kasr (i.e., “the palace”). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound.</li>\n<li>A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the city’s remains. Where the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The utter desolation of the city once called “The glory of kingdoms” (Isaiah 13:19) was foretold by the prophets. This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon.</p>\n<p>Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon and was captured, all the nobles slain, his children massacred, he was bound in chains, his eyes gouged out with a dagger and the sockets were cauterized with a hot iron poker. They manacled him like a slave, iron rings were forged around the ankles and linked together by a six-inch chain, and then a tight chain was placed around the waist, this was attached by a third chain in such a way that the prisoner could not run away. Once they arrived in Babylon they knew that if they tried to escape it would result in execution. So, for 70 years they lived and died in a foreign land. No one ever returned home from the exile.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Jeremiah 25:12-27</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.</blockquote>\n<p>They were to raise a flag on a mountain top—they were to yell at the top of their voice—make a motion with their hand to send information—the guards will see this and go into the command center and ready their troops.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 18:3; Jeremiah 50:2; Jeremiah 51:25-27; Isaiah 45:1-3; Jeremiah 51:58</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.</blockquote>\n<p>God is in charge of the army of Persia and has summoned them to battle; they are to execute the wrath of the Almighty on the Babylonians.

It is the chosen ones of the <strong>LORD</strong> that have been mustered to do battle against the Babylonians.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Jeremiah 50:2-3; Isaiah 45:1-2; Jeremiah 50:14-15; Joel 2:1-11</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</blockquote>\n<p>They were the <strong>Medes</strong> and Persians who came from the far horizons and were the instruments of God’s fury to destroy the whole land of Babylonia.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Jeremiah 50:3; Jeremiah 50:9; Jeremiah 51:11; Jeremiah 51:28</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</blockquote>\n<p>Yell and scream in terror for God is paying them a visit with devastation unheard of before in history.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 65:14; Jeremiah 51:8; Zephaniah 1:14; Amos 5:18; Isaiah 34:8</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:</blockquote>\n<p>When they see the coming warriors they are paralyzed and hysterical and are screaming in terror.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 51:20; Jeremiah 50:43; Ezekiel 7:17; Ezekiel 21:7; Nahum 1:6; Nahum 2:10</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.</blockquote>\n<p>Their hands are falling down and are limp as an old dish rag—their courage has melted away—the bold and brave Babylonians are as scared as a rabbit on the run—fear has griped them like labor pains of childbirth—they are staring at each other—their faces are ashy pale—they are horrified of the outcome.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 21:3-4; Isaiah 26:17; Daniel 5:5-6</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</blockquote>\n<p>Prophets had spoke of this day and now it has arrived—he is going to rid the earth of this merciless people, he will root out these sinners and exterminate the wicked.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 47:10-15; Jeremiah 50:40-42</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</blockquote>\n<p>The constellations are a black hole—sun refuses to shine—no moonlight. It is the darkest day in their history. When nations fall the prophets likens it to the darkening of the heavens. The sun represents the king and the queen the moon and high government officials to the constellations. God uses this illustration each time a country collapses.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 24:23; Ezekiel 32:7-8; Matthew 24:29</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.</blockquote>\n<p>When God paid them a visit with the Persian army he came to destroy the world for their evil.

Babylon, whose destruction and utter ruin are here predicted, was situated in the midst of a large plain, having a very deep and fruitful soil, on the Euphrates River.</p>\n<p>According to Herodotus, it had an enclosed wall 300 feet high, and fifty wide, on the top of which were small watchtowers of one story high, leaving a space between them, through which a chariot might pass and turn. On each side were twenty-five gates of solid brass; from each of which proceeded a street, 150 feet broad, making in all fifty streets; which, crossing each other at right angles, intersected the city into 676 squares, along which stood the houses, all built three or four stories high, and highly decorated towards the street; the interior of these squares was gardens, and pleasure grounds, etc.</p>\n<p>Its principal ornaments were the temple of Belus, having a tower of eight stories, upon a base of a quarter of a mile square; a most magnificent palace; and the famous hanging gardens, or artificial mountains raised upon arches, and planted with large and beautiful trees. Cyrus took it by diverting the waters of the Euphrates, which ran through the midst, and entering by the channel; and the river being never restored to its proper course, overflowed the whole country, and made it a morass.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 14:4-6; Jeremiah 51:41; Jeremiah 49:18</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:20</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</blockquote>\n<p>No one will ever live there—it will remain forever uninhabited—it will never rise again—Arabs and Nomads will not camp there at night—shepherds won’t take their flocks there because of the danger from wild animals.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 47:1-15</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:21</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</blockquote>\n<p>It will be a ghost town—turned over to the animals—a wildlife refuge—wild cats and desert demons—at night you will hear haunted howls—Jackals and serpents are the new tenants—wild goats and desert creatures will do their weird dance there. No one will serve them a “vacate the premise” notice.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 34:11-15</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 13:22</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.</blockquote>\n<p>Even the splendid palaces and rich estates will be occupied by dangerous will animals and poisonous snakes. Their stately mansions will be lived in by jackals and hyenas and screech-owls—time was running out—her doom was very near—close at hand when the prophet wrote this chapter.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ref:</strong> Isaiah 35:7; Deuteronomy 32:35; Jeremiah 51:33; Ezekiel 7:7-10</li>\n</ul>",
