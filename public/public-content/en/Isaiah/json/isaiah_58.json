  "content": "<p>Shout it out! Show my people what is wrong with their lives. These pious snobs pretended to enjoy Bible reading and temple services, but their mind and heart was empty. They folded their hands in prayer and bent the knee&#9472;but their hands were stained with blood. This people fasted, prayed and pretended. All they wanted was the almighty dollar. Their leaders judged for bribes&#9472;priests taught for cold cash&#9472;prophets predicted for pay&#9472;they abhorred judgment and perverted equity. On fast days they gathered to quarrel, they squabbled and wrangled till it broke out into a fist fight. This was not the kind of fast that God wanted&#9472;he wanted broken hearts and broken lives mended&#9472;but instead they put on a gunny sack and marked themselves with ashes. These people were out to skin anyone and everyone. They were vultures waiting for someone to default on a note so they could repossess their home and farms and sell their children as slaves. If they got their act straight God would light their morning with sunshine&#9472;restore their health and be their guide and rearward and then when they prayed God would answer. God would reveal to them where to go and they would be like a well watered garden. You will build homes on old foundations. From the past life you will build a new righteous life. You will be able to fix anything and everything&#9472;restore, renovate, and rebuild. Finally you will find your happiness in the LORD&#9472;you will ride on high and soar like an eagle and you will eat the heritage of Jacob.</p>\n\n<h2>Experiencing True Fasting and Repairing the Breach</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 58:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</blockquote>\n<p>Shout the message at the top of your lungs. Show my people what is wrong with their lives.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jeremiah 1:17-19:</strong> Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them...</li>\n<li><strong>Isaiah 56:10:</strong> (Read for context on watchmen.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 58:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.</blockquote>\n<p>These people showed up for temple service and pretended to love the reading of the law but all the while in their heart they despised the commandments of the law. Their piety was as artificial as saccharine. They prayed but their hands were full of blood.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isaiah 1:11-15:</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD...

Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.</blockquote>\n<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t God impressed with these folks? They fasted, prayed and pretended. They used the fast days to do business as usual&#9472;oppress the workers, and exploit people. Leaders were judging for rewards&#9472;priests were teaching for money&#9472;prophets divine for money&#9472;they abhorred judgment and perverted equity.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jeremiah 34:9-12:</strong> That every man should let his manservant... go free...

Is this what God wants&#9472;bowing ones head like a weeping cherry tree&#9472;putting on an old gunny sack and marking oneself with ashes?

They should have provided the wanderer with shelter&#9472;clothed the naked&#9472;(they would sell ones shirt of his back) they pretended that they didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Job 22:7:</strong> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</li>\n<li><strong>Proverbs 28:27:</strong> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniel 4:27:</strong> Break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 58:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy reward.</blockquote>\n<p>If they would do this their light would spring forth like morning sunshine&#9472;you will recover from your health problem&#9472;your own righteousness will go before you and God will bring up your rearward.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psalm 97:11:</strong> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</li>\n<li><strong>Psalm 112:4:</strong> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness...</li>\n<li><strong>John 12:46:</strong> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 58:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.

All you need to do is straighten up&#9472;stop unfair practices&#9472;quit gossiping&#9472;be generous with the hungry&#9472;cease perverting justice and then you will glow in the dark&#9472;you will have a new light to walk in.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isaiah 65:24:</strong> And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer...</li>\n<li><strong>Psalm 91:15:</strong> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 58:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:</blockquote>\n<p>If you open your heart to the hungry&#9472;it will be like thick darkness suddenly exposed to the bright sun at noon time.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deuteronomy 15:7-10:</strong> Thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother...

He will prepare a table before you. You will be like a garden with automatic sprinklers&#9472;like and ever flowing spring, even in time of draught.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isaiah 49:10:</strong> They shall not hunger nor thirst... even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</li>\n<li><strong>Job 5:20:</strong> In famine he shall redeem thee from death...</li>\n<li><strong>Jeremiah 31:9:</strong> I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 58:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</blockquote>\n<p>You will take old foundations and build new homes.
