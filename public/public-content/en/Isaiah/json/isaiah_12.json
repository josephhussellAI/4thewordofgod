  "content": "<p>God withdrew his anger and moved in to help them come home. Now they are singing his praises─GOD─yes, GOD is their strength and song─yea, he is their salvation. They are pulling up buckets full of salvation from the well of salvation. They are crying tears of joy and shouting the name of their God. They are telling everyone─from sea to shining sea─from valley to mountain top of what God has done for them and how he lives again in the holy city─they are spreading the word about Gods reputation.</p>\n\n<h2>Discovering Joy by Drawing from the Wells of Salvation</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 12:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.</blockquote>\n<p>They are pictured as praising God because the storm was past, His anger was abated and he was appeased.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 14:3</strong> And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 27:12-13</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, <em>that</em> the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. And it shall come to pass in that day, <em>that</em> the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 11:16; Isa 26:1; Isa 27:1-3; Isa 35:10; Zec 14:9; Zec 14:20; Isa 25:9</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 12:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.</blockquote>\n<p>God had delivered them and they are now living in confidence and unafraid. He was the source of their strength and the theme of their song.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 60:20-22</strong> Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Thy people also <em>shall be</em> all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 49:13; Psa 69:34-36; Psa 72:18-19; Psa 149:6; Rev 15:3-4; Rev 19:1-6; Hos 14:4-9</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 12:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</blockquote>\n<p>With triumphant joy they were drawing water from the fountain of deliverance.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 49:10</strong> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 55:1-3; Psa 36:9; Jer 2:13; Joh 4:10-14; Joh 7:37-39; Rev 7:17; Rev 22:17</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 12:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.</blockquote>\n<p>In the day of their deliverance they were saying thank you Lord we celebrate your name and we will tell the world what a wonderful God you are, your might and majesty will always be in grateful remembrance.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 106:47-48</strong> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <em>and</em> to triumph in thy praise. Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Psa 113:1-3; Psa 105:1; Isa 66:19; Jer 50:2; Psa 22:31; Jer 51:9-10</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 12:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.</blockquote>\n<p>All the marvelous things God had done caused them to break out into spontaneous singing; they wanted the whole world to know of his wonderful feats.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exo 15:1</strong> Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</li>\n<li><strong>Exo 15:21</strong> And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Psa 68:32-33; Psa 98:1; Psa 105:2; Rev 19:1-3; Hab 2:14; Eze 39:24-29</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 12:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</blockquote>\n<p>They were crying with joy and shouting till the rafters reverberated because God had brought them back from captivity to their homeland, and now the Holy One is dwelling in them and living among them.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 40:9</strong> O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift <em>it</em> up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 52:7-10; Luk 19:37-40; Isa 30:19; Zec 8:3-8; Isa 24:23; Isa 41:14; Zec 2:5,10,11</strong></li>\n</ul>",
