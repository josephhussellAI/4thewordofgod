  "content": "<p>From the stump of Jesse a root will produce a branch and God will give him extraordinary powers and he will be clothed in fairness and usher in a time of peace for he is the prince of peace. The prophet paints a picture of wild animals lying down with tame animals to depict the peacefulness of the messiah. He further sees the Messiah reaching out to the four corners of the earth and bringing back the remaining exiles. Isaiah paints a picture for us of the drying up of rivers and building roads so that the exiles can return. You are invited to explore the exposition and scripture references.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncovering the Branch of Jesse and the Kingdom of Peace</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 11:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:</blockquote>\n<p>The line of David will be chopped down and from the stump of Jesse will come forth a sprout that will grow into a mighty tree.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 53:2</strong> For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, <em>there is</em> no beauty that we should desire him.</li>\n<li><strong>Rev 5:5</strong> And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</li>\n<li><strong>Rev 22:16</strong> I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, <em>and</em> the bright and morning star.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read: <strong>Isa 11:10; Rth 4:17; 1Sa 17:58; Mat 1:6; Act 13:22-23; Rom 15:12; Isa 4:2; Mat 1:16; Jer 23:5; Zec 3:8; Zec 6:12</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 11:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;</blockquote>\n<p>This life giving spirit will fill him with wisdom and understanding it will supply him with direction and the fear of the Lord.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 42:1-4</strong> Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, <em>in whom</em> my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 61:1</strong> The Spirit of the Lord GOD <em>is</em> upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to <em>them that are</em> bound;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read: <strong>Joh 1:32-33; Joh 3:34; Joh 16:13</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 11:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:</blockquote>\n<p>This shoot from the stump of Jesse will have a sharp intellect and will not judge after appearance or listen to hear say.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 33:6</strong> And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, <em>and</em> strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD <em>is</em> his treasure.</li>\n<li><strong>Luk 2:52</strong> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 11:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</blockquote>\n<p>He will step forward for the poor and exploited and defend their cause; he will speak and just the breath from his lips will destroy the ruthless.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 45:6-7</strong> Thy throne, O God, <em>is</em> for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom <em>is</em> a right sceptre. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</li>\n<li><strong>Rev 19:11</strong> And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him <em>was</em> called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read: <strong>Jer 23:5-6; 2Sa 8:15; Mat 11:5; Isa 61:1; Rev 19:15</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 11:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</blockquote>\n<p>He will put on work clothes, tighten his belt of justice, roll up his sleeves with fairness and build up righteousness and faithfulness in the land.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 59:17</strong> For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance <em>for</em> clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke</li>\n<li><strong>Psa 93:1</strong> The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, <em>wherewith</em> he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 11:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.</blockquote>\n<p>Wolves will live with the lambs; leopards will share his bed with the kid goats, calves and lions eating from the same trough, beef cattle and lions laying down in mid-day together and a little child leading them with a lead rope. In those days wolf and lamb, lion and bullock, will dwell together.</p>\n<p>Daniel has a lion with eagle’s wings and a leopard with a fowl’s wings and four heads in Dan. 7, which represented the kingdom of Persia and Greece. When kingdoms stopped acting like animals and laid down their arms and become peaceful with their neighbors it could be said that the wolf was laying down with the lamb. When Israel returned from captivity wolf and lamb, lion and bullock are dwelling together.</p>\n<p><strong>Symbolism in the Scriptures:</strong></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Lion with four wings / Heart of a man</dt>\n<dd>Babylon receiving a heart transplant and becoming human.</dd>\n<dt>Bear with three ribs</dt>\n<dd>Persia (She had eaten up Lydia, Babylon and Egypt).</dd>\n<dt>Leopard with four wings</dt>\n<dd>Greece.</dd>\n<dt>Serpent's Root / Cockatrice / Fiery Flying Serpent</dt>\n<dd>Ahaz (Serpent's root) begat Hezekiah (Snake), who begat Manasseh (Fiery Flying Serpent). Manasseh was known for \"flying off the handle\" and his hot temper.</dd>\n<dt>Sheep</dt>\n<dd>Israel.</dd>\n<dt>Lion and Lamb</dt>\n<dd>Jesus.</dd>\n<dt>Fox</dt>\n<dd>Herod.</dd>\n<dt>Wolves</dt>\n<dd>False teachers.</dd>\n<dt>Dragon/Serpent</dt>\n<dd>Babylon.</dd>\n<dt>Flies</dt>\n<dd>Ethiopia.</dd>\n<dt>Crocodile</dt>\n<dd>Egypt.</dd>\n<dt>Bees and Hornets</dt>\n<dd>Syria.</dd>\n<dt>Worm</dt>\n<dd>Jacob.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In conclusion, it was no strange thing that wolves and lambs were eating together (a peace pact was made between nations), lions were eating with oxen. Snakes were eating dust and not biting their children. After careful examination of the scriptures, you will arrive at this conclusion: Israel has returned from captivity and Persia rules the world and all the nations were under this one world government and so the wolf was dwelling with the lamb.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 65:25</strong> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust <em>shall be</em> the serpent's meat.
