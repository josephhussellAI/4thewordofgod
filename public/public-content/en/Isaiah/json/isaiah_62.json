  "content": "<p>The prophet couldn’t hold his tongue and stop praying till the judges were restored, and Zion’s converts were righteous and salvation went forth like a blazing fire. Zion will be a crown of splendor and a royal diadem. Zion will no longer be called the God forsaken land. Their new names are <strong>Hephzibah</strong> and <strong>Beulah</strong>, meaning “God’s delight” and “The Bride.” The maker of atoms and angels is pleased with his new bride. Sentinels were interceding day and night for God to fulfill his promise. God swore by an oath that the foreigners would not eat their produce or drink their wine. The exiles are told to pass through the gates of Babylon and build roads to return to the homeland on. They are called a holy people─redeemed and saved. They will no longer be called forsaken by God but a people sought out.</p>\n\n<h2>Witnessing God's Delight and the Royal Restoration of the Bride</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 62:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> He couldn’t hold his tongue and stop praying till the judges were restored, and her converts with righteousness, and her salvation goes forth like a blazing torch.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isa 62:6-7:</strong> I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, <em>which</em> shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence, And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 62:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Foreign nations will see your righteousness─world leaders will see your glory.
