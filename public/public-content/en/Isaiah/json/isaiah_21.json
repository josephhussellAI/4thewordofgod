  "content": "<p>Isaiah has a vision regarding the future of Babylon—it will be attacked by the Persians and destroyed—never to be inhabited again. God’s people had been on their threshing floor and beaten like grain but this was all to end. He sees the last night when Daniel is called to interpret the handwriting on the wall—no one at the feast survives—Daniel was made the third ruler in the kingdom, however when morning arrives the kingdom was in the hands of the Persians. The commentary section will fill you in on all the details.</p>\n\n<h2>Deciphering the Prophetic Vision of the Watchman and Babylon's Fall</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</blockquote>\n<p>This inspired prediction is about the wastelands by the sea. Babylon had great dams which were used to raise and control the waters at the Euphrates River which overflowed it like a sea, sometimes it is referred to as a desert and sometimes as a sea. The first ten verses of this chapter contain a prediction of the taking of Babylon by the Medes and Persians; which is here called &quot;the desert of the sea,&quot; because the country around it, and especially towards the sea, was a great morass, often overflowed by the Tigris and Euphrates, and only rendered habitable by being drained by a number of canals.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 51:42</strong> The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 13:20-22; Isa 14:23; Gen 25:13</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</blockquote>\n<p>This harsh and dreadful vision came to Isaiah, roaring like a whirlwind—it was the judgment of God—God is telling Isaiah that he will send the army of Elam and Media—the combined forces were known as Persia—God says that the sighing thereof will cease—He is going to put an end to Israel’s moaning and groaning by sending Persia to destroy Babylon and the nations groaning will end.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 51:44</strong> And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 24:16; Jer 51:48-49; Dan 5:28; Dan 8:20</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.</blockquote>\n<p>The prophet is seized with pain when he sees the awful plunder of the golden city—his stomach is constricted and burns with pains—the vision leaves him writhing in anguish and gripped in pain like a woman having a baby. He is dismayed—too distressed to hear and too afraid to look—it leaves him stunned and dazed at the awful slaughter and destruction of the principal city of the universe.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dan 5:5-6</strong> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 16:9; Hab 3:16; Jer 49:22; Jer 50:43</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.</blockquote>\n<p>His mind reels—the horror fills him with fear—he is like a man gripped in convulsions. He sees the last night of Babylon—God reveals the feast of Belshazzar—the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, the table is loaded with food and wine, the party is in full swing—the golden vessels taken from God’s temple are used to toast the idols of Babylon. He watches the handwriting on the wall by a disembodied hand—Daniel is awakened and summons to the banquet hall—his relaxed evening is turned into a nightmare—he sees the king slain—every politician and ruler killed and the kingdom of Babylon come to an end.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 51:57</strong> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</li>\n<li><strong>Dan 5:1</strong> Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</li>\n<li><strong>Dan 5:5</strong> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</li>\n<li><strong>Dan 5:30</strong> In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</blockquote>\n<p>The banquet is in full swing—food, drink—but suddenly they learn of the city being stormed by the Meads and Persians—they jump up from the table and rush to the armory—but all to no avail.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 51:39</strong> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Dan 5:1-5; Isa 13:17-18; Isa 45:1-3; Jer 51:11, 27-33</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</blockquote>\n<p>The Lord directs his attention to the watchman (Babylon’s security guards) to supply him with information regarding the siege.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 51:30-31</strong> The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>2Ki 9:17-20; Jer 51:12-13</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</blockquote>\n<p>The watchman, with his ear to the ground and his eye to the horizon, reports that he sees horses and wagons in long lines in battle formation.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 37:24</strong> By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</blockquote>\n<p>The watchman reports—crying like a lion pouncing on its prey that he has been at his post of duty day and night and watched whole nights but something unusual is happening on the horizon.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 56:10</strong> His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Jer 4:7; Jer 49:19; Psa 127:1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</blockquote>\n<p>What the watchman sees is a train of men mounted on horses and riding in chariots—the latest war news headlines: BABYLON IS FALLEN! FALLEN! Her idols have fallen—shattered and broken to pieces—loaded on oxcarts and carted to the recycle place to be melted and their gold and other alloys reused.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 50:2-3</strong> Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Jer 50:9; Jer 50:42; Jer 51:8; Jer 51:64</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</blockquote>\n<p>God’s people had been threshed and beaten like threshing of grain on the threshing floor—but, here is the good news—BABYLON IS FALLEN!</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 51:33</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>2Ki 13:7; Hab 3:12</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</blockquote>\n<p>The prophet Isaiah touches on the doom of Dumah (Edom). What of the night? This probably means that the night of Edom’s fall is sure to come—as sure as daybreak comes in the morning.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amo 1:11-12</strong> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 34:1-8; Isa 63:1-6; Jer 49:8-13; Oba 1:1-9</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.</blockquote>\n<p>What’s left of the night? It appears in this short verse that he his saying that Edom’s judgment day is dawning.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 50:27</strong> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Eze 7:5-7</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.</blockquote>\n<p>This caravan of Dedanites are camping out in the badlands of Arabia—The citizens of Tema hauled water and provided bread for the fleeing refuges.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 49:28-32</strong> Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side. Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone. And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Jer 25:23-24; Eze 27:20-21</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:14</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.</blockquote>\n<p>The horrors of war had left streams of refuges that were living on the edge of the desert of Arabia and if it had not been for Tema bringing water they would have perished.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gen 25:15</strong> Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:15</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</blockquote>\n<p>They were fleeing from an army that had bows and arrows and swords—as the prophet puts it—the grievousness of war.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Job 6:19-20</strong> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:16</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</blockquote>\n<p>Be patient for within a year (two ways to figure a year, one is a calendar year and the other is a fiscal year) this year could begin in any month and end in the same month the following year—what the prophets tells us is that in one year this tribe of Arabians who had lived by brutality would come to an abrupt end.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 60:7</strong> All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Gen 25:13</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 21:17</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.</blockquote>\n<p>God says it’s all over for the mighty men of Kedar—the heroes and mighty warriors will be few in number—the God of Israel has spoken it.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zec 1:6</strong> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</li>\n</ul>",
