  "content": "<p>Ariel is about to experience a blood bath. They will be encircled with an army from Assyria—the enemy will build forts and blockade the city. It will be a swarm of invaders that encamp Jerusalem but they will be scattered like chaff. Their voice will be like a ghost of the past and they will lie buried in the ground. All of the above will happen suddenly.</p>\n<p>Assyria will come with an appetite for war and will vanish like a dream. When this happens it will befuddle your wits—you will be bamboozled and amazed. Read 2 Kings 32 where all these events happened. But Israel’s eyes were closed and their ears were muffled—the events that were to happen were like a sealed book to them. When God brings the events to fruition they will be astonished and amazed. God will turn Lebanon into a fruitful forest again. The blind will see God’s plans—the humbled and poor rejoice—the tyrant (Sennacherib) will vanish—scoffers cease—evil doers will be killed. All the above and more are waiting for your understanding in the commentary section.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncovering the Prophecy of Ariel and the Sealed Book</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 29:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.</blockquote>\n<p>A woe is pronounced against the city where David dwelt.
