  "content": "<p>Hezekiah and his princes and officers shall govern in equity and wisdom. They will protect the innocent and oppressed. He will promote the instruction of the laws of God. He will treat everyone with fairness. Worthless, hypocritical officials will be detected and debarred from their office. The upright will be blessed and prosper.</p>\n\n<h2>Unveiling the Righteous King as Our Divine Shelter</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.</blockquote>\n<p>A righteous king is coming and shall rule with justice and his princess&rsquo;s shall rule rightly. Notice that even his princes shall rule in judgment.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>2 Chronicles 31:20:</strong> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.</li>\n  <li><strong>Psalm 72:1-2:</strong> A Psalm for Solomon. Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son. He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> Psalm 99:4; Jeremiah 33:15</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</blockquote>\n<p>This righteous king will shelter Israel from storm and wind&mdash;he will be like a shelter and shade&mdash;he will be like refreshing water from a river in the desert.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Micah 5:4-5:</strong> And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</li>\n  <li><strong>Isaiah 32:18:</strong> And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.</blockquote>\n<p>His people will listen to him and he will be an eye opener.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isaiah 35:5-7:</strong> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> Isaiah 29:18; Isaiah 29:24</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.</blockquote>\n<p>Hot heads and people given to sudden impulses will readily hear and speak.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isaiah 29:18:</strong> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Isaiah 29:24:</strong> They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> Mark 7:37; Isaiah 29:24; Nehemiah 8:8; Matthew 11:25; Exodus 4:11; Luke 21:14-15</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful</blockquote>\n<p>Fools, atheist and scoundrels will not be their heroes. Cheaters and impious will not be considered as outstanding men. The generation of Hezekiah&rsquo;s reign was a reign of outstanding great men.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isaiah 5:20:</strong> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</li>\n  <li><strong>Malachi 3:18:</strong> Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> 1 Samuel 25:3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</blockquote>\n<p>Out of the abundance of the heart one speaks.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>1 Samuel 24:13:</strong> As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</li>\n  <li><strong>1 Samuel 25:10-11:</strong> And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> Jeremiah 13:23</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.</blockquote>\n<p>When people mediate on evil they will speak and act treacherously.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Jeremiah 5:26-28:</strong> For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> Isaiah 5:23; Micah 2:11; Psalm 10:7-10</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.</blockquote>\n<p>Noble people make noble plans and sticks by his word.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Psalm 112:9:</strong> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> 2 Samuel 9:1-7</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.</blockquote>\n<p>The prophet calls for the idle, complacent women to listen to his advice. When mothers are sunk in indolence, and careless of the instruction of their children in righteousness the welfare of the nation suffers as a whole.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Isaiah 3:16:</strong> Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> Amos 6:1-6</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.</blockquote>\n<p>In a little more than a year the harvest will fail and no fruit will be gathered in.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Jeremiah 8:13:</strong> I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.</li>\n  <li><strong>Joel 1:12:</strong> The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read:</strong> Isaiah 16:10</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 32:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.</blockquote>\n<p>They will be trembling when disaster strikes and will strip of their pretty clothes and put on an old gunny sack and they will beat upon their breast in grief.</p>",
