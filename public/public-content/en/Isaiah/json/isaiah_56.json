  "content": "<p>God calls for his people to be fair and just, for he was coming to rescue them. The people who observe the <strong>Sabbath</strong> and stay out of trouble are happy. God says that Gentiles and eunuchs are not going to be second-class citizens and they must not think of themselves as a dried-up tree. He promises them full participation and privileges in the new order. They will be given a new name. Gentiles flocked to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices and God's temple was called the <strong>House of Prayer</strong>. The leaders were pin heads—never warning of impending danger—they were greedy looking after their own interest. They only thought about a six pack, partying and another repeat tomorrow. God will send people who act like animals to devour them.</p>\n\n<h2>Unveiling the True House of Prayer and Blind Watchmen</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</blockquote>\n<p>The LORD says: Observe justice and execute righteousness for his salvation was close at hand and victory over their enemy (Babylon) was about to be revealed.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 1:16-20:</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</blockquote>\n<p>The man or woman who does this is happy—the person who observes the <strong>Sabbath</strong> and does not engage in evil deeds.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 1:1-3:</strong> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Exo 31:13</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</blockquote>\n<p>Gentiles—foreigners—eunuchs—need not think of themselves as a <strong>dried-up tree</strong>. They will not be regarded as second-class citizens but accepted on equal terms with the Jews.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zec 8:20-23:</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:4-5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</blockquote>\n<p>The eunuchs (the Babylonians had castrated many of the Jews) who chose the word of God and keep the Sabbath and clung to the precepts would enjoy all the benefits afforded to them in the covenant. God promises them in the temple and inside Jerusalem’s walls a memorial—yes a <strong>name better than if they had been sons and daughters</strong>. The Ethiopian eunuch is forever remembered as we read Acts 8.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Act 8:27:</strong> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians...</li>\n<li><strong>Isa 62:12:</strong> And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD...</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Rev 3:12</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:6-7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.</blockquote>\n<p>Many foreigners joined with the Jews and inquired the way to Zion—they loved the LORD, kept the Sabbath and clung to the covenant. They will come to Jerusalem and worship the same as “insiders.” They will burn incense and often animal sacrifices and the temple will be known as a <strong>House of Prayer for all people</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 50:5:</strong> They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward...</li>\n<li><strong>Mal 1:11:</strong> For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles...</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Isa 58:13, Isa 66:19-20</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</blockquote>\n<p>God gathered the outcasts from Spain, Africa, Turkey and Greece and besides this the Gentiles came to the light and kings to the brightness of his rising.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 60:3:</strong> And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Psa 106:47</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.</blockquote>\n<p>The wild animals (heathen savages) were invited to come and gorge themselves on the sheep—devour the <strong>blind shepherds</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deu 28:26:</strong> And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth...</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Rev 19:17-18</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.</blockquote>\n<p>These <strong>dumb dogs</strong> were blind and ignorant—they never barked when danger was staring them in the face—they just lay down with their beer and wine and partied while the country was on the brink of ruin.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jer 14:14:</strong> Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name...</li>\n<li><strong>Read:</strong> Mat 23:16; Nah 3:18</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</blockquote>\n<p>These dogs (leaders, shepherds) were greedy as a dog—they had a voracious appetite. They were interested only in their own gain; each was pursuing his own purpose.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1Sa 2:12-17:</strong> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 56:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s get drunk and tomorrow will be as wonderful as today, maybe even better. Wine, beer, partying, feasting, dumb dogs that would soon be devoured by the savage heathen. Their motto, “Live it up!”</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 28:7:</strong> But they also have erred through wine...</li>\n<li><strong>1Co 15:32:</strong> ...let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</li>\n</ul>",
