  "content": "<p>This chapter takes us from the crib to the cross to the crown. When God came in human flesh no one believed the report&mdash;he grew up as a root out of dry ground&mdash;the first 30 years of his life is shrouded in mystery. He wasn&rsquo;t the most handsome man in Galilee yet he had a moral beauty that was indescribable. This chapter describes the contempt in which the leaders held him. They beat him within an inch of his life and finally nailed him to the cross. Israel&rsquo;s supreme-court denied him justice and so the trial was a miscarriage. As the drama plays out he is crucified between two convicted felons and ends up being buried in a rich man&rsquo;s tomb. The prophet conceals the final outcome under an enigma till the resurrection finally happens. This chapter ends with a bright side by telling us that the spoils of the victor (Christ) will be divided among the great ones.</p>\n\n<h2>Unveiling the Divine Path from Crib to Cross to Crown</h2>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</blockquote>\n<p>Jesus was rejected at the hands of the Jews. Paul applies this passage to them in Romans 10:16.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Joh 12:38</strong> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Joh 10:26; Rom 10:16-17</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</blockquote>\n<p>A metaphor&mdash;referring to Jesus as a tender plant, and a root out of dry ground. Jesus was a branch from the root of Jessie. He was a root out of dry ground. Jessie had been dead for over 1,000 years and the last king to reign from that dynasty was Coniah which was 600 years before Jesus. It had been a long dry season since a king ruled over Israel. There was no beauty that they should desire him&mdash;the pictures that we have of Jesus were painted by Michelangelo 1475-1564. But to us Jesus was attractive in another way&mdash;his <strong>moral beauty</strong>&mdash;his holiness and benevolence, his gentleness and interest in the unworthy, his stainless purity of life. His forgiveness, rest to the spiritual weary, his unfailing friendship to the troubled and lonely, he was to us altogether lovely and beautiful.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zec 6:12</strong> And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Isa 11:1; Jer 23:5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</blockquote>\n<p>This describes the contempt in which men hold Jesus. They did not appreciate his worth. Some hid their faces as he walked by&mdash;others spurned him&mdash;they held him in low esteem.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 50:6</strong> I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Psa 22:6-8; Zec 11:12-13</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</blockquote>\n<p>The door of prophecy opened wide for him to pass through but they treated him as an imposter.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mat 8:17</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Gal 3:13; Heb 9:28; 1Pe 3:18; 1Jn 2:2</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</blockquote>\n<p>He bore our sins and became our sacrifice. It was our rebellion that caused him to be crushed. He was lashed&mdash;the blows that landed on him healed us.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dan 9:24</strong> Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</li>\n<li><strong>Zec 13:7</strong> Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.</li>\n<li><strong>Rom 4:25</strong> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</li>\n<li><strong>Heb 10:14</strong> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</li>\n<li><strong>1Pe 3:18</strong> For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</blockquote>\n<p>We were the ones that had wondered away&mdash;we left the right path and chose the path of least resistance.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 119:176</strong> I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.</li>\n<li><strong>1Pe 2:25</strong> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</li>\n<li><strong>Eze 34:11-12</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</blockquote>\n<p>He was beaten, tortured&mdash;treated violently&mdash;but never opened his mouth.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mat 26:63</strong> But Jesus held his peace...</li>\n<li><strong>Mat 27:12-14</strong> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing...</li>\n<li><strong>1Pe 2:23</strong> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again...</li>\n<li><strong>Act 8:32-33</strong> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</blockquote>\n<p>Justice miscarried&mdash;no one seemed to know what was happening and didn&rsquo;t care. By force and without protection he was accused, tried, judged and illegally condemned. Yet paying the price on demand, without a proper trial, nor defense, nor witness on his behalf, for crimes not his own&mdash;but ours. His best friends feared to declare his innocence.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mat 26:65-66</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy...</li>\n<li><strong>Joh 19:7</strong> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</blockquote>\n<p>He was buried as a criminal in a rich man&rsquo;s grave. He died with the vilest and was buried with the richest.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mat 27:57-60</strong> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple... And laid it in his own new tomb...</li>\n<li><strong>1Co 15:4</strong> And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</blockquote>\n<p>The atonement always contemplated an offering for sins. Under the Jewish economy the high priest entered the Holy of Holies with the blood of an animal to atone for himself and his congregation (Lev. 16:2, 3.) Jesus our high priest entered heaven&mdash;the corresponding Holy of Holies &ldquo;with his own blood to atone once for the sins of the world.&rdquo; Heb. 9:24. He would see his seed&mdash;the resurrection meets the difficulty and solves the riddle of this difficult verse. (Rev. 1:18)</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Isa 42:1</strong> Behold my servant, whom I uphold...</li>\n<li><strong>Dan 9:24</strong> Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people...</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>2Co 5:21; Joh 12:24; Isa 9:7; Psa 16:9-11</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</blockquote>\n<p>It pleased the LORD to bring men from darkness to light. The knowledge which saves the soul is the gospel which is the power of God unto salvation.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Luk 22:44</strong> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly...</li>\n<li><strong>Joh 12:27-32</strong> Now is my soul troubled... And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</li>\n<li>Read: <strong>Heb 12:2; Heb 9:28</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Isaiah 53:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</blockquote>\n<p>When kings returned from a victorious battle they divided the spoils among their people. Jesus likewise was victorious over hell and the grave and he has divided the spoils with his ransomed ones. Christ the King has blessed us with all spiritual blessing&mdash;chosen us, adopted us, accepted us, redeemed us, revealed his will to us, gave us an inheritance, sealed us with his Holy Spirit and gave us wisdom and revelation.</p>\n<h4>Cross References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psa 2:8</strong> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance...</li>\n<li><strong>Dan 2:45</strong> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands...</li>\n<li><strong>Mar 15:28</strong> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</li>\n<li><strong>Heb 9:28</strong> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many...</li>\n<li><strong>Heb 7:25</strong> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</li>\n</ul>",
