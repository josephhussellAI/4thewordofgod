  "content": "<p>Resettlement plan—A lottery was used to determine who would live in Jerusalem. In 1990 the U.S. census revealed that for the first time a majority of Americans lived in cities having more than a million in population. Worldwide, people are flocking to mega-cities. Not so in Nehemiah’s day. The Israelites had learned that big cities like Jerusalem made prime targets for invading armies. In order to repopulate the city, leaders had to resort to a lottery system.</p><h2>Securing the Holy City Through Divine Selection</h2><h3>Nehemiah 11:1</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the remaining nine were to stay in their own towns.</blockquote><p>Ten percent of the people living in towns other than Jerusalem were required to move to Jerusalem. They cast lots to determine who was to move into the <strong>Holy City</strong>.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:2</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The people commended all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.</blockquote><p>The volunteers were applauded for their willingness to move to the <strong>Holy City</strong>.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:3</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem (now some Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants and descendants of Solomon's servants lived in the towns of Judah, each on his own property in the various towns,</blockquote><p>The following verses will give us the names that were on the roster of those who moved to Jerusalem.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:4-6</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">while other people from both Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem): From the descendants of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, a descendant of Perez; and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, a descendant of Shelah. The descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem totaled 468 able men.</blockquote><p>Judah and Benjamin possessed the territory that included Jerusalem prior to the dispersion and now the population will be more diverse. These verses gives us insight into the genealogy of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin who had formally controlled Jerusalem before the captivity and their appointments at this time puts them back in control of the governing of Jerusalem.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:7-9</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">From the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah, and his followers, Gabbai and Sallai—928 men. Joel son of Zicri was their chief officer, and Judah son of Hassenuah was over the Second District of the city.</blockquote><h3>Nehemiah 11:10-14</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">From the priests: Jedaiah; the son of Joiarib; Jakin; Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, supervisor in the house of God, and their associates, who carried on work for the temple—822 men; Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah, and his associates, who were heads of families—242 men; Amashsai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, and his associates, who were able men—128. Their chief officer was Zabdiel son of Haggedolim.</blockquote><h3>Nehemiah 11:15-18</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">From the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; Shabbethai and Jozabad, two of the heads of the Levites, who had charge of the outside work of the house of God; Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the director who led in thanksgiving and prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his associates; and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. The Levites in the holy city totaled 284.</blockquote><h3>Nehemiah 11:19</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon and their associates, who kept watch at the gates—172 men.</blockquote><h3>Nehemiah 11:20</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The rest of the Israelites, with the priests and Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, each on his ancestral property.</blockquote><p>As each family came back from captivity they inherited the property formally owned by their relatives. The following verses of Scripture will give us an understanding of property rights.</p><h4>Cross References</h4><ul><li><strong>Gen 31:14</strong> “Then Rachel and Leah replied, \"Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?”</li><li><strong>Num. 18:21</strong> “I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the Tent of Meeting.”</li><li><strong>Num. 27:7</strong> “What Zelophehad's daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives and turn their father's inheritance over to them.”</li><li><strong>Num. 34:2</strong> “Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter Canaan, the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance will have these boundaries:”</li><li><strong>Num. 36:3</strong> “Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.”</li><li><strong>I Ki. 21:-1-4</strong> “Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite... But Naboth replied, \"The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.\"... He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.”</li></ul><h3>Nehemiah 11:21</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of them.</blockquote><p>This verse tells us the location in Jerusalem where these people resided.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:22</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. Uzzi was one of Asaph's descendants, who were the singers responsible for the service of the house of God.</blockquote><p>In the days of David a group under the direction of Asaph was designated as the singers. I suppose they sang at all the services at the temple compound—probably sang at all town meetings—could have been at times on tour throughout the country singing the Psalms (Scripture). They were professional singers and as such were on the payroll.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:23</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">The singers were under the king's orders, which regulated their daily activity.</blockquote><p>In this verse the Levite choir was under the king’s orders, which stipulated their activities. I suppose that this refers back to the time that King David had created the singing group and designated their responsibilities. Their daily schedule was probably posted on the bulletin board. If it refers to king Artaxerxes he would have delegated the responsibility to Nehemiah because Artaxerxes was a thousand miles from Jerusalem.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:24</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was the king's agent in all affairs relating to the people.</blockquote><p>Any concerns that the people had been relayed to the King by the people’s representative.</p><h3>Nehemiah 11:25-36</h3><blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">As for the villages with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its surrounding settlements, in Dibon and its settlements, in Jekabzeel and its villages, in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet, in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its settlements, in Ziklag, in Meconah and its settlements, in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its settlements. So they were living all the way from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom. The descendants of the Benjamites from Geba lived in Micmash, Aija, Bethel and its settlements, in Anathoth, Nob and Ananiah, in Hazor, Ramah and Gittaim, in Hadid, Zeboim and Neballat, in Lod and Ono, and in the Valley of the Craftsmen. Some of the divisions of the Levites of Judah settled in Benjamin.</blockquote><p>I have grouped these verses together as the subject matter is the same—these are villages and towns scattered throughout the territory where the new settlers are re-establishing their families. The Levites did not receive any inheritance but were to live among the other tribes. In this verse only Judah is mentioned.</p>",
