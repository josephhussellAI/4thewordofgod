  "content": "<p>More opposition—more opposition—more opposition—His enemies are filled with opposition, schemes and secrecy. They were engaged in a letter writing campaign—next they try to intimidate Nehemiah by threatening assassination—He could see thru these so called prophets like looking thru water in a gold fish bowl.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncovering the Divine Strategy for Standing Firm Against Intimidation</h2>\n\n<h2>Further Opposition to the Rebuilding</h2>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:1</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates-</blockquote>\n<p>This project was moving at a fast pace—all the breaches in the wall had been closed. Anchor bolts for door hinges; building of the doors and bars was ahead of schedule but had not been installed.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:2</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: &quot;Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.&quot; But they were scheming to harm me;</blockquote>\n<p>Sanballat and his gang are as wily as a fox in the henhouse. With a new scheme up their sleeve they are contriving an artful plan to do physical harm to Nehemiah.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:3</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">so I sent messengers to them with this reply: &quot;I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Nehemiah was not about to fall for the hellish plan of these weasels. Nehemiah is oblivious to their plan—so he sends back a message that he is too busy to meet with them. Nehemiah was as wary as a wildcat.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:4</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.</blockquote>\n<p>Four times—four failures by his enemies their messages were futile. Nehemiah was as prudent as spotting a row number in a shopping mall parking lot. He was as discreet as a diplomat.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:5</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter</blockquote>\n<p>Five times—and five failures—now he writes a letter on parchment and rolls it up but does not seal it he wants this to be read by others and then they can sow the seed of discord among the workers.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:6</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">in which was written: &quot;It is reported among the nations—and Geshem says it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king</blockquote>\n<p>They plan on worrying Nehemiah by circulating a story that an insurrection is planned by the Jews against the Persian king Artaxerxes. Nehemiah remains indifferent to their call for a meeting.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:7</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Sanballat is as crafty as a crow in the cornfield—he is playing the Devil’s advocate. He is threatening Nehemiah with a “wanted poster.”</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:8</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I sent him this reply: &quot;Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Nehemiah shoots back a brilliant reply—you made it all up—Nehemiah lets them know that they are acting like a berserk bedbug.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:9</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, &quot;Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.&quot; But I prayed, &quot;Now strengthen my hands.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Sanballat was using psychological warfare—the artful strategy of planting fear in the mind of Nehemiah. He is trying to frighten Nehemiah into the depths of despair.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:10</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, &quot;Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Nehemiah’s pretended friend Shemaiah concocts a new plan—hiding in the temple—Nehemiah could smell a rat and knew that Shemaiah’s plan was as loco as a loon.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:11</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">But I said, &quot;Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Nehemiah was as brave as captain Kangaroo at Suribachi. He was as courageous as Daniel at the Lion’s den.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:12</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</blockquote>\n<p>It didn’t take long for the “wisdom of Solomon” to germinate in the head of Nehemiah—he could see thru their plan—he knew that Shemaiah was getting paid to say these things.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:13</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.</blockquote>\n<p>What a lying hypocrite—dirty politics at its worst—bankrupt morals—he just bought a ticket to Hell.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:14</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.</blockquote>\n<p>Remember Tobiah—Sanballat—Noadiah the prophetess—and the rest of the prophets. Nehemiah had to deal with these cut throats throughout the entire building project. But they ended up like Watergate. This bunch of cornered rats will get what’s coming to them.</p>\n\n<h2>The Completion of the Wall</h2>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:15</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</blockquote>\n<p>This event was as breathless as a sudden death overtime win. For this wall to be built in 52 days was like a hundred year old man winning a marathon race.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:16</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.</blockquote>\n<p>The work progressed—the wall was built—everyone knew that this super-human effort was none other than an act of God.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:17</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.</blockquote>\n<p>A letter writing campaign followed—these letters concealed the secrets of their campaign to halt the work of Nehemiah.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:18</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.</blockquote>\n<p>Wow! Remember Shemaiah of verse 10—He was the son-in-law of Tobiah. There was more to the story—peer pressure from the family —this was like a gas leak in a sealed room.</p>\n\n<h3>Nehemiah 6:19</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"primary-scripture\">Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.</blockquote>\n<p>The spy network is now discovered—the source of the leaks to Tobiah was coming from his in-laws. All the while Nehemiah was careful and discreet with his words as a statement from the state department.</p>",
